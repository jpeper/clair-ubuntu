[08:10] <Peppernrino> and: sudo apt-get install cuda
[08:10] <Peppernrino> says cuda needs cuda...
[08:10] <Peppernrino> lol
[08:11] <Peppernrino> could it be because i installed xorg-edgers?
[08:11] <Peppernrino> i saw on a forum that it causes problems occasionally.
[08:12] <mgor> simpsonc, have you tried without psr? I had flickering issues with it enabled

[08:15] <Peppernrino> install cuda says needs cuda-7-5, instal cuda-7-5 says needs nvidia-drivers... etc
[08:16] <mgor> simonf, do you have /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf? if so remove enable_psr, also check /etc/default/grub and make sure you don't have i915.enable_psr in any of the GRUB_CMDLINE... (when changing /etc/default/grub, don't forget to run sudo update-grub)
[08:16] <cart_Man> mjayk: Well it just said : " E:Unable to locate package device-tree-overlay
[08:17] <simpsonc> less /etc/modprobe.d/i915.comf
[08:17] <simpsonc> ach...sorry
[08:19] <simpsonc> mgor: I recently had to re-install the OS due to issue with attempting to upgrade the kernel, so I'm back to 4.4.0-36...there is also no reference at all to psr in /etc/default/grub:
[08:19] <simpsonc> simpsonc@simpsonc-nbk:~$ sudo grep psr /etc/default/grub

[08:20] <simpsonc> simpsonc@simpsonc-nbk:~$is there another way to check if it's enabled?
[08:20] <Peppernrino> error: not a command
[08:20] <mgor> simpsonc, shouldn't be enabled unless you have explicitly enabled it
[08:21] <simpsonc> ah ok...then that doesn't appear to be the issue...it's definitely something specific with 16.04 since it only presented itself after I upgraded from 15
