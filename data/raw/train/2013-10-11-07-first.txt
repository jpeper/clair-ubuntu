[06:49] <foofoobar> Hi. So I get this strange wifi connection problems: http://pastebin.com/Dh9ijK1K I found a thread on the manufacture forums of my model (dell xps 13 with ath9 driver) where ppl suggest two different solutions:
[06:49] <foofoobar> 1) update kernel
[06:49] <foofoobar> 2) install a backport
[06:49] <foofoobar> This is the thread: http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/os-applications/f/4613/t/19515554.aspx
[06:49] <foofoobar> What is more "safe"? I dont want to lose functionality like the keys on my keyboard to controll background light
=== mozzie- is now known as garson
[06:51] <Ben64> foofoobar: safest would be to get a different wireless card
[06:51] <Tylertwo> what'stuBe27to
[06:51] <gulag2013> foofoobar, always check the physical. You checked the wires correct?
[06:52] <foofoobar> gulag2013, the wires for the wireless connection? :D
[06:52] <foofoobar> The wireless ap is a connection I'm using a long time, just with a different notebook
[06:52] <foofoobar> Ben64, I cant replace the card of my notebook
[06:52] <Ben64> you probably can, but i meant usb
[06:54] <foofoobar> uh, no. I dont want to attach a usb wireless every time
[06:54] <foofoobar> It would be nice to get this card working on ubuntu
[06:54] <foofoobar> I read that on windows it has no problems
[06:54] <foofoobar> There are also two suggestions on the thread
[06:54] <Ben64> get a tiny one
[06:55] <foofoobar> I'm just trying to figure out which is the better one
[06:55] <Ben64> can stay plugged in all the time
[06:55] <foofoobar> No, this is not a solution for me :/
[06:55] <foofoobar> This notebook is new. I dont want to extend it because of a software bug
[06:56] <foofoobar> so .. backport or linux kernel update? :)
[06:56] <Ben64> you don't want to extend the notebook?
[06:56] <Ben64> what does that even mean
[06:57] <gordonjcp> foofoobar: I don't see anything in your paste that suggests a problem
[06:58] <cfhowlett> foofoobar, backport is the "safer" method I would say.
[06:58] <gordonjcp> foofoobar: have you filed a bug?
[06:59] <cfhowlett> foofoobar, Also, let me point out that LTS is the preferred OS so 12.04.3
[06:59] <Ben64> foofoobar: might help if you post more details, like what wireless card, what version of ubuntu

[07:34] <NetCatty> what happend to the bottom panel in nautilus 3.8.2?
=== CyclicFlux is now known as Guest29308
=== Harry is now known as Guest8455
[07:35] <swaagie> day to of the skype will not install due to held  broken packages, missing skype-bin, on ubuntu 13.04, clean not had any previous version installed, followed https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype but not until after I did a manual install, tried all repository/apt clean/purge/fix commands, anybody any other pointers
[07:35] <Dr_Willis> a lot of nautilus featres have been getting trimmed out NetCatty
=== Guest8455 is now known as Harryfromthebloc
=== Harryfromthebloc is now known as Jupp
[07:36] <Dr_Willis> sunny_:  lightdm is the default. but i tend to use gdm because i like it better. ;)
[07:36] <sunny_> Dr_Willis, than i need to try gdm
[07:36] <Dr_Willis> sunny_:  also i think xubuntu and lubuntu have differnt lightdm themes.
[07:36] <swaagie> day two* btw
[07:37] <Dr_Willis> actually i Might be usng xubuntu's on this netbook. Im not sure ;) its a cleaner layout then the default ubuntu lightdm look
[07:37] <NetCatty> Dr_Willis: that's just swell. Whoever thought that "trimming" the bottom panel would be a great idea? I cant read the last file name cuz it's been overlayed with the pop-up notification
[07:38] <Dr_Willis> NetCatty:  cant say ive noticed. general gnome trend for the last few years has been to remove stuff and make everything cleaner if less functional.
[07:38] <NetCatty> Dr_Willis: is there a way to stop the notification pop-up at the bottom?
[07:39] <Dr_Willis> im nore annoyed at a lot of the other things removed from notilus
[07:39] <sunny_> Dr_Willis, is their any theme package for lightdm ?
[07:39] <Dr_Willis> NetCatty: what desktop are you using?
[07:39] <NetCatty> gnome 3
[07:39] <Dr_Willis> sunny_:  check the package manager and see. It may depend on your release
[07:39] <Dr_Willis> NetCatty:  id look at the gnome3 extensions and see if theres one to put them somewhere else
[07:40] <Dr_Willis> i dont use gnome-shell much
[07:40] <sunny_> Dr_Willis, ok
[07:40] <sunny_> Dr_Willis, which DE you use ?
