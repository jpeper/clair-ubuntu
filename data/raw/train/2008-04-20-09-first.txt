[08:42] <Starnestommy> to restart it, sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start
[08:42] <VoidedCheck> my intel chipset choked on gutsy
[08:42] <Starnestommy> kajo: it calls scripts in /etc/init.d/
[08:42] <VoidedCheck> worked fine on hardy though
[08:42] <VoidedCheck> yay for kernel improvements

[08:45] <VoidedCheck> that's like $10000
[08:45] <dude_> arvind_khadri, no luck, I'm in windows
[08:46] <Kamus_H_Zwisch> a very stupid question: how do i upload a local file to a remote server via telnet?
[08:46] <arvind_khadri> dude_: hmm use the super grub live cd then
[08:46] <dude_> CURSE YOU BILL GATES!  CUUURSSE YOUUUUU!!!!
[08:46] <tiocsti> kamus: you dont, use scp instead?
[08:46] <dude_> super grub live cd?
[08:46] <VoidedCheck> anyway, g'night ubuntu land
[08:46] <arvind_khadri> dude_: http://forjamari.linex.org/projects/supergrub/
[08:47] <dude_> arvind_khadri, well can't I just edit the boot.ini file from here?
[08:47] <arvind_khadri> dude_: :) if thats readable
[08:47] <arvind_khadri> dude_: use the super grub its easy to setup
[08:48] <arvind_khadri> dude_: totally for newbies
[08:48] <dude_> arvind_khadri, wow, floppy based!  Sweet!  my cd burner is screwed so I can use that
[08:48] <gabbs> How do I get rid of avahi messing up my wifi on boot?
[08:48] <arvind_khadri> dude_: happy linuxing
[08:48] <RenaKunisaki> ok, so
[08:48] <RenaKunisaki> "grub install (hd0) failed - this is a fatal error" - is my hard drive toast?
[08:48] <arvind_khadri> RenaKunisaki: grub lost??
[08:49] <RenaKunisaki> arvind_khadri, apparently; I deleted all the partitions and reinstalled it and it failed with that at 94%
[08:49] <arvind_khadri> RenaKunisaki: you need to install completely
[08:50] <dude_> arvind_khadri, dammit, how do I work with an .img file?
[08:50] <dude_> haha
[08:50] <RenaKunisaki> arvind_khadri, what do you mean completely?
[08:50] <arvind_khadri> RenaKunisaki: i mean that you might havent done the partitions cleanly so boot into live cd and do everything properly
[08:50] <Hemebond> Is someone able to help me compile ETQW under an x86_64 system? I'm getting compatibility errors with libstdc++.
[08:51] <arvind_khadri> dude_: did you find out how to do that
[08:51] <RenaKunisaki> arvind_khadri, this is the live CD
[08:51] <arvind_khadri> RenaKunisaki: do the install again
[08:51] <dude_> arvind_khadri, I'm researching the .img extension right now
[08:51] <arvind_khadri> dude_: i think you need to just copy paste and then boot from the cd
[08:51] <c0Ld> i just accidently hit something to enable compiz zooming on hardy...what did I hit? I can't seem to turn it off :/
[08:52] <arvind_khadri> dude_: i mean the floppy
[08:52] <bazhang> c0Ld: try asking in #compiz
[08:52] <dude_> arvind_khadri, I wouldn't think so, it doesn't work that way with an .iso file, it shouldn't be the same for a floppy
[08:52] <arvind_khadri> bazhang: to the rescue
[08:52] <bazhang> hi arvind_khadri ;]
[08:52] <arvind_khadri> bazhang: help in restoring grub

[08:54] <Vini> Hi, I had ndiswrapper working before, than it stopped (don't know why). I've followed the same tute I did earlier, but I think the problem is my network settings.  Is there some easy way to make /etc/networks and /etc/network return to defaults from install?
[08:54] <bazhang> arvind_khadri: sure what's up with grub? did you read the !grub factoid?
[08:54] <Vini> (without having to re-install everything)
[08:54] <arvind_khadri> bazhang: not me its dude_
[08:54] <arvind_khadri> bazhang: we tried everything but it doesnt restore
[08:55] <Exteris> Vini, get them from someone else?
[08:55] <Vini> But then it will have their settings in in :(

[08:56] <dude_> arvind_khadri, sure am
[08:56] <arvind_khadri> dude_: well did you read !grub
[08:56] <RenaKunisaki> arvind_khadri, OK, installing again
[08:57] <Exteris> Vini, ask some newbie then :P

[09:00] <arvind_khadri> dude_: ask bazhan
[09:00] <rewati> roseman i dont think make menuconfig is for makin menu
[09:00] <arvind_khadri> dude_: ask bazhang
[09:00] <arvind_khadri> rewati: its for displaying a menu
[09:00] <tiocsti> dialog can be used for menus like that
[09:00] <RenaKunisaki> arvind_khadri, what happened was I decided to just delete everything and reinstall XP and Xubuntu, but when I started the XP installer it wouldn't even run
[09:00] <tiocsti> either the library or the program
[09:00] <unique> i try to run the configure file for my drivers and the system cant open it.. it says not ...application available
[09:00] <unique> could some one tell me what i need?
[09:01] <arvind_khadri> RenaKunisaki: do clean the disks properly...format everything
[09:01] <RenaKunisaki> arvind_khadri, I booted a DOS disk and deleted all partitions with fdisk and then was able to create the partitions and install XP, but then this happened
[09:01] <dude_> I think I got the floppy made
[09:01] <dude_> I was right, you need special software
[09:01] <arvind_khadri> RenaKunisaki: might be the disk of DOS aint proper..use the live cd to format ;)
[09:02] <arvind_khadri> dude_: hmm njoi ;)

[09:07] <bazhang> theLichKing: not here it does not
[09:07] <SnakeyeS> bazhang: so wubi is a windows app that assists with the installation?

[09:12] <bazhang> SingAlong: what about downloading the iso and burning to cd and then running the livecd of 7.10
[09:13] <bazhang> compumike: not even hardy uses that kernel

[09:16] <bazhang> SnakeyeS: well either up the ram or get some really ultra-lightweight distro
[09:16] <SingAlong> bazhang: Yeah couple of minutes. My ubuntu installation is just over. Need to reboot the notebook
[09:18] <tiocsti> im not sure how happy ubuntu would be in 128m ram, might wanna use xubuntu instead
[09:18] <SingAlong> bazhang: I ran the command thru the livecd itself. I got a whole list of details
[09:18] <unique> Please install the package with full kernel sources for your distribution dose any one know what syn that would be

[09:23] <bazhang> SingAlong: please dont talk about that here
[09:23] <atlas95> I up it somewhere, wait
[09:23] <SingAlong> bazhang: ok ok... But I found a better solution. Unigraphics, the company that produces Solidedge gives away a free version for 2D drawings.
[09:24] <SingAlong> bazhang: Thats what we need.

[09:25] <Dr_willis> gd,  vnc can be set up to share the current desktop - or create a 'hidden' virtual desktop that you can only see/connect to with a vnc client.

[09:27] <Dr_willis> heikkus,  give more detailas as to what it does do . when you try to boot the live cd
[09:27] <bazhang> SingAlong: hehe; that has happened to me in the past--just try some variations and if not then boot into the live cd and change it
[09:27] <Vasa> Or  how can  I disable antialias?
[09:28] <DOOM_NX> <astro76> DOOM_NX: the public key should be in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys -> yes it's there, but how do i know if it's being used?
[09:28] <bazhang> heikkus: you need to provide more than just bare bones info
[09:28] <DOOM_NX> <slacker> DOOM_NX: it'll automatically try if your ssh client offers pub key authentication => i don't have a 2nd pc to test it right now

[09:29] <ranma_1\2> too late :P
[09:30] <Dr_willis> you can boot a live cd, then chroot into the installed system, and use the passwd USERNAME command to set a new password. is one way. rescue mode may let you do it also
[09:30] <heikkus> hmm. it tries to boot from the cd but then just says the cd is unbootable :E i tweaked the bios so that it only boots from the cd-rom and not at all from the hard drive
[09:30] <Dr_willis> heikkus,  look on the cd. what files are on the cd? what program did you use to burn the iso to cd?

[09:31] <DOOM_NX> RSA key fingerprint is e4:c0:e5:23:8c:e6:f7:98:70:08:1a:b7:85:0f:f0:90.
[09:31] <DOOM_NX> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
[09:31] <slacker> you're sure
[09:31] <heikkus> i think the cd is ok cause it installed fine on my newer system
[09:31] <astro76> DOOM_NX: you'll get that either way the first time
[09:31] <SingAlong> Dr_willis: the command please (I m a linux noob)
[09:32] <bazhang> ask B3NZ1N0
[09:32] <arvind_khadri> !ask | B3NZ1N0
[09:32] <ubotu> B3NZ1N0: Please don't ask to ask a question, ask the question (all on ONE line, so others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely answer. :-)
[09:32] <slacker> DOOM_NX: you can remove 'localhost' from the list of known hosts afterwards if you like
[09:32] <slacker> it's also in ~/.ssh/
[09:32] <heikkus> i burned it with cdburnedxp pro at the library
[09:33] <Dr_willis> SingAlong it might be faster if you just reinstall and REMBER your password then.
[09:33] <DOOM_NX> <slacker> it's also in ~/.ssh/ -> what is there?
[09:33] <B3NZ1N0> my mIRC is saying 4 days more to chat of because I have not registered I taught there is a way I might be able to get through to regiser  so that I will not be seeing such things and I can chat with mIRC for life
[09:33] <arvind_khadri> SingAlong: what do you want
[09:33] <DOOM_NX> the key u mean?
[09:33] <DOOM_NX> how do i know if it's using it... cause i need to connect from winxp using putty
[09:33] <bazhang> B3NZ1N0: switch to a linux client or pay up
[09:33] <Dr_willis> SingAlong,  in short. boot to recovery/rescue mode to get to a shell.  mount the installed system, chroot /mountpoint, passwd username.   Of course all that is total magic to you. :) but i dont know the specifcs of your system.
[09:34] <slacker> DOOM_NX: known_hosts. don't worry about it
[09:34] <SingAlong> arvind_khadri: I forgot the password after installation. I tried a lot of variations. Now I got it!
[09:34] <arvind_khadri> B3NZ1N0: use xchat ;)
[09:34] <slacker> DOOM_NX: if it asks for a password, it's not using the key.
[09:34] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,  you can get a free versionof xchat for windows and dump mIRC
[09:34] <SingAlong> Dr_willis: Thank you! I tried a lot of variations and got it now!
[09:34] <slacker> DOOM_NX: there are howto's that explain what you have to do to get pub key auth working with putty and opensshd
[09:35] <arvind_khadri> SingAlong: boot into the recovery mode and add a new user
[09:35] <SingAlong> bazhang: Now I have to run lspci right?
[09:35] <SingAlong> arvind_khadri: Oh I need to keep that in mind if I forget the password again :)
[09:35] <bazhang> SingAlong: yes and !paste the output (not here to pastebin)
[09:35] <arvind_khadri> !paste | SingAlong
[09:35] <ubotu> SingAlong: pastebin is a service to post multiple-lined texts so you don't flood the channel. The Ubuntu pastebin is at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org (make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic)
[09:35] <Dr_willis> learn to rember your passwords :)
[09:35] <slacker> DOOM_NX: you can either create a new pub key with putty or import the one you created with ssh-keygen I think
[09:35] <B3NZ1N0> so no one can help me with the registration code nor a way to break this code?
[09:35] <arvind_khadri> bazhang: the factiod when calling a name doesnt work ;)
[09:36] <SingAlong> ubotu: yeah sure friend
[09:36] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,   No. we dont care about mIRC one way or another...
[09:36] <arvind_khadri> B3NZ1N0: no piracy
[09:36] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,  it has NOTHING to do with linux.
[09:36] <arvind_khadri> B3NZ1N0: sudo apt-get install xchat
[09:36] <B3NZ1N0> but you are using mirc
[09:36] <DOOM_NX> <slacker> DOOM_NX: there are howto's that explain what you have to do to get pub key auth working with putty and opensshd -> i was reading that while setting it up
[09:36] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,  totally WRONG., we are using IRC.
[09:36] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,  mIRC is one of MANY irc clients.
[09:36] <bazhang> !piracy > B3NZ1N0
[09:36] <DOOM_NX> slacker, i created one with ssh-keygen and imported it to putty
[09:37] <Dr_willis> !irc | B3NZ1N0
[09:37] <ubotu> B3NZ1N0: A list of official Ubuntu IRC channels, as well as IRC clients for Ubuntu, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat - For a general list of !freenode channels, see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#channellist - See also !Guidelines
[09:37] <DOOM_NX> but is the ssh server using the key? cause putty is...
[09:37] <Boohbah> B3NZ1N0: try xchat
[09:37] <SingAlong> bazhang: I got a big result. As I said I am on my cop and instaling linux on my notebook(I cant connect to net on notebook. Thats what I need to do). So it would be better if u tell me what kinda card I need to search for?
[09:37] <slacker> DOOM_NX: did you copy the id_xxx.pub file to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys?
[09:37] <SingAlong> *comp
[09:37] <DOOM_NX> slacker yes
[09:37] <DOOM_NX> i followed this guide: http://linux-sxs.org/networking/openssh.putty.html
[09:38] <slacker> DOOM_NX: on the linux, what happens after you type ssh localhost?
[09:38] <B3NZ1N0> !irc
[09:38] <ubotu> A list of official Ubuntu IRC channels, as well as IRC clients for Ubuntu, can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat - For a general list of !freenode channels, see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#channellist - See also !Guidelines
[09:38] <JPSman> so I see that you can download a lot of amateur ham radio software, but when i run it it needs /dev/mixer   why?
[09:38] <bazhang> SingAlong: do you have ethernet for the laptop? or just can run a terminal in it? dont need net access for that, just the laptop running
[09:38] <DOOM_NX> slacker,  ssh localhost
[09:38] <DOOM_NX> Enter passphrase for key '/home/doom/.ssh/id_rsa':
[09:38] <JPSman> er /dev/radio      why?
[09:39] <unique> wow i want to thank every one that helped me i tryed for 2 weeks to get this sound card to work thank you!
[09:39] <B3NZ1N0> so whats XCHAT like, can I chat with pple using mirc?
[09:39] <arvind_khadri> !dev | JPSman
[09:39] <ubotu> JPSman: Interested in becoming an Ubuntu Developer? Get started here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment
[09:39] <SingAlong> arvind_khadri: I can connect the internet wire.
[09:39] <slacker> DOOM_NX: that's the password for your key. you can use ssh-agent to manage that. otherwise you have to type it in every time
[09:39] <SingAlong>  bazhang: I can connect the internet wire.
[09:39] <Starnestommy> B3NZ1N0: yes. any IRC client can chat with people using any client
[09:39] <arvind_khadri> JPSman: oops sorry /dev are the device files
[09:39] <slacker> DOOM_NX: that's NOT your login password
[09:39] <DOOM_NX> slacker, i typed it... ok what happened?
[09:39] <B3NZ1N0> and I can scan also?
[09:39] <bazhang> SingAlong: that would be best really
[09:40] <SingAlong> bazhang: I have a laptop running.
[09:40] <slacker> DOOM_NX: it didn't complain?
[09:40] <arvind_khadri> JPSman: so you would need a receiver for that
[09:40] <Starnestommy> B3NZ1N0: what do you mean by 'scan'?
[09:40] <DOOM_NX> slacker, no :(
[09:40] <DOOM_NX> it said
[09:40] <slacker> DOOM_NX: should work from windows too
[09:40] <B3NZ1N0> I mean scan for mailers and so on?
[09:41] <DOOM_NX> Linux doom-desktop 2.6.22-14-generic #1 SMP Tue Feb 12 07:42:25 UTC .....
[09:41] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,  mailers?
[09:41] <JPSman> arwind_khadri : what are the chances that I can build one?
[09:41] <slacker> DOOM_NX: did you point putty at the right location of the pub key?
[09:41] <astro76> !ot | B3NZ1N0
[09:41] <DOOM_NX> what does this mean?
[09:41] <ubotu> B3NZ1N0: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[09:41] <slacker> DOOM_NX: means it works. you're logged in to localhost
[09:41] <bazhang> SingAlong: if you wish, then connect the ethernet wire/cable and then pastebin the output of lspci to the pastebin site--tell us the address then we can go read it without flooding the channel
[09:41] <B3NZ1N0> mean
[09:41] <DOOM_NX> slacker, yes but... i don't think it will ever be able to connect because windows is a guest os in vbox... using NAT...
[09:42] <B3NZ1N0> this cahn sucks
[09:42] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,   the various irc clients for linux, can do about anytying that mIRC can do.. and many things mIRC cant do. - irc clients connect to irc servers, and join channels so you can chat. :)
[09:42] <SingAlong> bazhang: yeah will get back
[09:42] <bazhang> B3NZ1N0: please read the /topic
[09:42] <DOOM_NX> slacker, how do i unlog? :P
[09:42] <arvind_khadri> B3NZ1N0: building them is no chance for users ..its a developer thing ...so why dont you get a device.../dev/ points to the devices you have
[09:42] <DOOM_NX> logout*
[09:42] <B3NZ1N0> I dont use linux
[09:42] <slacker> DOOM_NX: ctrl+d
[09:42] <Dr_willis> B3NZ1N0,   Then why are you hanging in a Linux related channel?
[09:42] <slacker> DOOM_NX: from your windows, can you ping the linux box?
[09:42] <bazhang> B3NZ1N0: please exit and go to ##windows thanks
[09:43] <DOOM_NX> slacker, no because i'm using NAT
[09:43] <slacker> DOOM_NX: so why are you even trying to get ssh working for it?
[09:43] <DOOM_NX> i was just trying to see how putty works
[09:43] <DOOM_NX> i didn't expect it to connect
[09:44] <slacker> putty doesn't do much without a server to connect to
[09:44] <DOOM_NX> i know... just the settings
[09:44] <slacker> ic
[09:44] <DOOM_NX> so slacker if i import the key to another PC
[09:44] <DOOM_NX> using putty
[09:44] <DOOM_NX> and try to connect, will it connect?
[09:44] <heikkus> wow im gonna try this flubuntu thingy ->
[09:44] <Redhammer_the_Ol> tv
[09:44] <root> Hey all
[09:45] <zvacet> root ask
[09:45] <thoreauputic> root: Using IRC as root is a silly idea, in case you didn't know :)
[09:45] <DOOM_NX> slacker, i sued "vncviewer localhost:1" and got this: http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5290/screenshotvncdoomsxdeskyk0.png
[09:45] <explorer2> 8.04 looks just like 7.10 :( :((
[09:46] <root> Im on root
[09:46] <root> user on Ubuntu
[09:46] <thoreauputic> root: why?
[09:46] <root> Forgot to chang
[09:46] <Dr_willis> we can tell that from your nick. :)
[09:46] <root> I run my own web server
[09:46] <thoreauputic> root: your /whois shows "root"
=== root is now known as Habbotom
[09:47] <Dr_willis> we are safer now? :)
=== master_o1_master is now known as master_of_master
[09:47] <thoreauputic> Habbotom: changing your nick doesn't change the fact that you are using IRC as root :)
[09:47] <Habbotom> ;)
[09:47] <Habbotom> thoreauputic: Whats wrong with using it
[09:48] <slacker> DOOM_NX: putty can do pub key authentication, if you have the settings right. it works for me
[09:48] <thoreauputic> Habbotom: in some channels you would be kicked :) It's not a secure thing to do
[09:48] <DOOM_NX> slacker, i guess so, but see what VNC shows...
[09:48] <thoreauputic> Habbotom: make a user accout and do your on line stuff with that
[09:48] <newbieu> can someone help me , i can record sound on ubuntu
[09:49] <slacker> so, nobody around who used videotrans before?
[09:49] <newbieu> *cnat
[09:49] <slacker> DOOM_NX: vnc doesn't use ssh
[09:49] <newbieu> *cant
[09:49] <Habbotom> Cant use Lammp on any other user
[09:49] <thoreauputic> Habbotom: nonsense
[09:49] <Habbotom> Can only start it on root user
[09:50] <Habbotom> Its normally known as Xammp
[09:50] <DOOM_NX> slacker, so... how can i use VNC over SSH? server: ubuntu, client: winxp
[09:50] <Starnestommy> Habbotom: have you tried using sudo?
[09:50] <slacker> ah well, i shall have a black background then
[09:50] <popey> DOOM_NX: ssh tunneling
[09:50] <JPSman> can I watch TV with linux?
[09:50] <Habbotom> Nope
[09:50] <explorer2> me +x
[09:50] <slacker> DOOM_NX: you have to tunnel the correct port using ssh -L
[09:50] <thoreauputic> Habbotom: yo are missing the point I'm afraid - all you need to do is create a user for other purposes - any linux can do that
[09:50] <popey> DOOM_NX: putty on windows supports tunneling
[09:50] <DOOM_NX> slacker, i see... but i can set that on putty, no?
[09:51] <slacker> DOOM_NX: sorry. you setup port forwarding from withing putty
[09:51] <Dr_willis> JPSman,  depends on how you define watch tv. My tv tuner card does work with linux. and i can go to most of the web-sites that have tv broadcast/bideos
[09:51] <DOOM_NX> okai
[09:51] <thoreauputic> Habbotom: then you simply do "su <otheruser>
[09:51] <DOOM_NX> so is everything ok in the server's side?
[09:52] <Vasa> hi, my laptop fan runs 80% on ubuntu, 5% on Live ubuntu, and  5 % on XP runtime. What can cause it?
[09:53] <slacker> I've gotta go - housewarming
[09:53] <slacker> DOOM_NX: she'll be right
[09:53] <slacker> cu guys
[09:53] <DOOM_NX> slacker, thank u
[09:53] <DOOM_NX> aw
[09:53] <DOOM_NX> :(
[09:54] <Vasa> Could it be, that my cpufreq output says, that no driver installed?
[09:54] <popey> DOOM_NX: http://martybugs.net/smoothwall/puttyvnc.cgi
[09:55] <DOOM_NX> what is smoothwall?
[09:55] <thoreauputic> DOOM_NX: specialised Linux Firewall distribution
[09:55] <DOOM_NX> popey
[09:55] <DOOM_NX> why should i need smoothwall?
[09:56] <Vasa> any idea?
[09:56] <thoreauputic> DOOM_NX: Usually as a gateway/firewall on a LAN etc.
[09:56] <astro76> DOOM_NX: perhaps that link tells you how to tunnel vnc over ssh using putty? just a guess...
[09:57] <DOOM_NX> astro76, yes i know, but do i need smoothwall?
[09:57] <cherva> can I swap the cannels of my souncard ?
[09:57] <thoreauputic> DOOM_NX: probably not
[09:57] <astro76> DOOM_NX: no
[09:57] <DOOM_NX> okay
[09:57] <chalcedony> ive got problems with our router dying, comcast told me to unplug it, but it had the same probem 3 times.. not transmitting any pings.
[09:57] <harmental> hey guys....does anybody know a tool for creating video captures (besides wink and recordmydesktop)??
[09:57] <astro76> !screencast | harmental
[09:57] <ubotu> harmental: Some programs to capture your screen are recordmydesktop, Istanbul, Wink, Gvidcap, Xvidcap, vnc2swf, demorecorder.  Also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreenCasts.
[09:58] <DOOM_NX> anybody knows why "vncviewer localhost:1" shows: http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/5290/screenshotvncdoomsxdeskyk0.png
[09:59] <harmental> astro76: thx!!
[09:59] <Bogaurd> how early in bood are the symlinks in /dev/disk/by-id/ established? would it be before MDADM arrays are started?
[09:59] <Bogaurd> boot*
[09:59] <chalcedony> i don't even know where to start to debug the router..
[09:59] <Vasa> any idea with cpufreq?
