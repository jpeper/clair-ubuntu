[09:47] <fabian> after formatting the first three
[09:47] <krz> ubuntu doesnt have sshd??
[09:47] <krz> in /etc/init.d/ ?
[09:47] <maihem> I think I have a bug, but it may just be a misconfiguration. I set the Gamma of my screen in the xorg configuration, and now all the GTK widget backgrounds and all the icons are pale. Is there a way to configure gtk to assume a gamma of 1.0 (since the X server is performing the adjustment), the font rendering already assumes a gamma of 1.0 (which is why I set my X server to adjust).

[09:51] <pinkpanther> how do I manually uninstall something?
[09:51] <wastrel> what are you uninstalling
[09:51] <fabian> fangorious, do you have any pointer to instructions?
[09:51] <pinkpanther> Berkeley DB
[09:51] <fangorious> fabian: but as to the original problem, of the mystery partition, maybe boot a live cd to see what's on it, and delete it if it's stuff you don't care about
[09:51] <wastrel> how did you install it?
[09:51] <fangorious> fabian: instructions for which suggestion?
[09:51] <pinkpanther> through make

[10:02] <maihem> Cryptid: you can try opening /etc/X11/xorg.conf using your favourite text editor (via sudo), searching for "nvidia" and replacing it with "nv". Then run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
[10:02] <fangorious> zebraFusion: it means there's a bug in the driver which prevents you from using a certain video output mode
[10:02] <ploom> mm - can ext3 filesystem become fragmentated too??
[10:02] <krz_> fangorious, ok
[10:02] <maihem> RememberPOL: it is in Dapper. It was released after Breezy, so that's why it's not in there.

[10:03] <RememberPOL> maihem: Yes but why not allow current Breezy users be able to upgrade to it?
[10:03] <zebraFusion> fangorious, but it says to do something and I have no idea what
[10:03] <zebraFusion> so we want to start "gstreamer-properties" and tell it not to use xv for video. (This is the same as starting "Multimedia Systems Selector", a Preferences application that is currently hidden in your menu system)
[10:03] <wastrel> RememberPOL:  because breezy was frozen before 1.5 was released
[10:03] <fangorious> zebraFusion: on the menubar at the top of your screen you'll see "System", which has a "Preferences" sub-menu, which in turn has a "Multimedia Systems Selector" item which lets you specify the video output mode

[10:04] <maihem> RememberPOL: because whole new versions cmoe out once every siz months, so on average you only have to wait for three.
[10:04] <RememberPOL> I thought new Ubuntu versions were to feature complete new software packages and system features not just upgraded versions of the same package that could just as well be available using the Update Manager?
[10:04] <zebraFusion> fangorious, if you read the paragraph it says it's currently hidden in your menu system.
[10:04] <maihem> Cryptid: ah, gedit is not going to work in this case. try sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[10:04] <RememberPOL> maihem: But okay thank you. I will follow the wiki:FirefoxNewVersion instructions.
[10:04] <fangorious> zebraFusion: the program started by that menu item is 'gstreamer-properties', which you can also start by typing that into a terminal (Applications->Accessories->Terminal)
[10:04] <maihem> Cryptid: There is probably only one occurrence of "nvidia". It will be in the "Driver" section.

[10:07] <fangorious> thegladiator: you mean uptime? run 'uptime' in a terminal
[10:08] <maihem> Cryptid: It is possible that it won't fix the problem. If the opensource nvidia driver (nv) doesn't support your graphics card it won't work.

[10:26] <Corsair> will other os's still be ok to store data onto it?
[10:26] <OmegaAlpha> Corsair, FAT32
[10:26] <fangorious> Corsair: then just share it with samba for windows machines, and nfs for linux machines
[10:26] <notos> its posible to upgrade from debian sarge to Ubuntu 5.10 ?
[10:27] <Corsair> its not letting me format it as fat32

[10:29] <fangorious> Corsair: you can configure the shares with System->Administration->Shared Folders
[10:29] <Corsair> yea, i know
[10:29] <Corsair> i got samba to share a file earlier, but it didnt want to let me write to it

[10:30] <ChunkAhoy> im trying to build linux-source-2.6.12
[10:30] <Toma-> ChunkAhoy, what is in the alsa directory that you just untarred? use pastebin
[10:30] <Toma-> !pastebin

[10:31] <Toma-> ChunkAhoy, well youre certainly not following this guide.
[10:32] <tritium> ChunkAhoy: do you need extremely new alsa source, or why are you going through all of that effort?
[10:32] <ChunkAhoy> ??
[10:32] <Toma-> ChunkAhoy, you dont need to build a kernel.
[10:32] <ChunkAhoy> thats what it says    lol   :)
[10:32] <Toma-> ChunkAhoy, are you READING this guide? or just copy and pasting the commands?
[10:32] <ChunkAhoy> i am reading it
[10:33] <Toma-> there is no step where you build a kernel.
[10:33] <ChunkAhoy> the problem is i dont really understand everything so i do all the commands he did
[10:34] <tritium> ChunkAhoy: you really shouldn't do that

[10:40] <graveson> fangorius : what is the default root password.when i installed ,i was not asked what the root passord would be .The reason being maybe i should create another user or login as root and see if that works
[10:40] <ablomen> graveson: same as your first user account
[10:41] <Madpilot> !tell graveson about sudo
[10:41] <fangorious> OmegaAlpha: it's the code in the kernel that interfaces with the sound hardware
[10:41] <dr-slizer> graveson: There is no root password, use sudo. If you want to set a root password, run sudo passwd
