[03:47] <scguy318> I've a question. I'm trying to get a Plustek Opticpro 4831p parallel port scanner to work, SANE says it's fully supported, but when I press the scan button in XSane, I get failed to start scanner: invalid argument message.
[03:47] <xzased> I still cant manage to restart/restore the x server
[03:47] <xzased> How do I get to a command line?
[03:48] <suttles95> borndeer:  when I type that in, I just get a prompt
[03:48] <poeticrpm> nickrud, if he doesnt know chances are he hasnt installed 32bit on his 64bit OS
[03:48] <CoasterMaster> xzased, Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
[03:48] <KDuB> thank you all for the help!
[03:48] <jahnkeanate1> where can i get a driver for a lexmark 4300
[03:48] <nickrud> scguy318, have you tried scanimage , see if that works?
[03:48] <speeddemon8803> you can get to a command line by going to applications, accessories terminal

[03:49] <KDuB> scguy318, once installed where do i go to open? just type fuseiso
[03:49] <xzased> I cant get to my pc basically
[03:49] <nickrud> scguy318, looking at an alias I haven't used in years, something like scanimage --mode Grayscale --resolution 300dpi
[03:49] <jahnkeanate1> is it possible to print with a lexmark 4300
[03:49] <CoasterMaster> xzased, ahhh....does it leave you with a login prompt?
[03:49] <scguy318> KDuB: man fuseiso for information on using it
[03:49] <xzased> nope
[03:49] <scguy318> nickrud: alright
[03:49] <jahnkeanate1> i cant find a driver
[03:49] <j1solutions> hello all
[03:49] <ronnie> hi~
[03:49] <CoasterMaster> xzased, hmmm, that's strange....I'm not too sure then, sorry :(
[03:50] <nickrud> scguy318, it's in sane-utils I think
[03:50] <ogre> scguy318:  im trying to get rid of that panel & run it off AWN with an applet. the only thing i dont have is nm-applet
[03:50] <xzased> Thanks, there is not much documentation on how to solve this
[03:50] <j1solutions> are there 'drivers' for linux?
[03:50] <poeticrpm> suttles95, did that show you? There should be an "about gnome" section under system, and a section in the system monitor

[03:51] <scguy318> nickrud: I'm aware, thanks
[03:52] <jahnkeanate1> can wine run vista programs
[03:52] <poeticrpm> gnome should have the same in the "about gnome" section

[03:52] <scguy318> nickrud: I end up with
[03:52] <Ttech> winkman: Why?
[03:52] <jahnkeanate1> ok
[03:52] <scguy318> nickrud: scanimage: sane_start: Invalid argument
[03:53] <poeticrpm> that will tell you suttles95, good to know
[03:53] <speeddemon8803> Winkman why would you want to as older versions are buggy and have major issues.
[03:53] <winkman> Ttech: because the new firefox has stopped my keyboard from functioning properly within firefox

[03:54] <jmak> it says invalid mount option
[03:54] <nickrud> scguy318, well, it worked well in 2004, I used it in an openoffice macro to scan receipts into my expense reports. But I don't see it in the options now either
[03:55] <doorknob60> foso?
[03:55] <winkman> Ttech: would you know of another reason? I've lodged a topic here, but i can't find any solutions... it's only happening in firefox. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3961327

[03:59] <winkman> Ttech: It only enters one keystroke per second... even if i type much faster
[03:59] <doorknob60> hey foso, u there? if so i know how to get the program to work
[03:59] <winkman> nothing else is running, and it's only affected in firefox
[03:59] <Ttech> remove and reinstall firefox?
[03:59] <haymaker> sethk, it says "Cannot Mount Volume.  Invalid mount option when attemtping to mount the volume."
[03:59] <Joe_Dirt> Filefl1, I have tried nmap, I must be doing it wrong because it's not finding ports that I know are open.

[04:00] <christos> hey im using a x1300 radeon graphics card and cant use desktop effects in 7.10 even with the restricted drivers enabled any solutions?
[04:00] <haymaker> sethk, so i guess my question is how can i modify the default mount options that flash drives use to automount
[04:00] <Filefl1> Joe_Dirt: i don't know how to use it exactly :)
[04:00] <winkman> Ttech: I can give it a try, i tried to re-install, but didn't remove it first...
[04:01] <sethk> haymaker, that lives in the udev configuration because it's a hot plug event.  See if there is an entry for sda1 in /etc/fstab, and, if so, what the options are that are being used there.
[04:01] <borndeer> Everyone using Google Desktop on ubuntu ? How can i install GoogleCalendar gadgets?

[04:02] <speeddemon8803> todd...yeah lol
[04:02] <ToddEDM> hwilde: huh?
[04:02] <wers> will it use less resources if I remove one of the two panels? :)
[04:02] <speeddemon8803> clear all private data in firefox
[04:02] <hwilde> ToddEDM, clear all private data it is like in the menu
[04:02] <speeddemon8803> tools
[04:02] <ToddEDM> ohh
[04:02] <speeddemon8803> clear private data
[04:03] <hwilde> all of them tho check all the boxes
[04:03] <haymaker> sethk i see, the entry for sdb1 is udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec
[04:03] <Joe_Dirt> Could someone suggest a simple port scanner.
[04:03] <SeveredCross> nmap.
[04:03] <Filefl1> lol
[04:03] <haymaker> sethk, this is because i dont have a cdrom on the machine, so i can just remove it from fstab?
[04:03] <Filefl1> sorry :)
[04:03] <ToddEDM> cool thanks guys.... whats the reason behind that ?
[04:03] <soldats> namp

[04:04] <ToddEDM> Guest039:  rename the files

[04:04] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt nmap*
[04:04] <sheng> is it possible to run itunes
[04:04] <sheng> using wine?
[04:04] <haymaker> sethk, yah that worked.
[04:04] <SeveredCross> sheng: Probably, but why would you wanna do that?
[04:04] <paradox> hello.
[04:05] <sheng> cus i tried
[04:05] <winkman> sheng: Check the appdb on winehq.com
[04:05] <sheng> to sync
[04:05] <sheng> with amarok and it doesn't work
[04:05] <Ttech> winkman: you good at apt?
[04:05] <hwilde> !enter | sheng
[04:05] <ubotu> sheng: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[04:05] <SeveredCross> sheng: Have you tried using Rhythmbox or Banshee?
[04:05] <wers> speeddemon8803: so that means, removing the other panel makes my computer faster, right? :)
[04:05] <NoiseBO1> So what to do when adding a module to the blacklist does not prevent it from loading at boot time?
[04:05] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, I actually tried nmap but I think I don't know how to use it  Because it's not finding open ports that I know are open.
[04:06] <hwilde> wers, a tiny fraction of a second faster yes.
[04:06] <deCon> for some reason, my desktop background has taken over -- as in it doesn't display my menu bars...help!?!?!
[04:06] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt how you using it??
[04:06] <wers> hwilde: so it's not worth it?
[04:06] <sheng> yes, i tried both of these, and they messed up my playlist. now i have no songs on my ipd
[04:06] <hwilde> wers, personal preference I guess
[04:06] <wers> ooh
[04:06] <wers> I prefer two panels but I want to make my computer as fast as possible
[04:06] <wers> hehehe
[04:07] <LordLuke> .cannabischat.com
[04:07] <hwilde> wers, then run icewm it is lightweight window manager.  gnome is more complex
[04:07] <deCon> Can someone please help me fix my desktop -- it hid my menu panels???????????!!!!!!
[04:07] <SeveredCross> sheng: Okay then. It should be possible to run iTunes, yeah...Just install Wine, download iTunes setup. Double-clicking it should actually run it, I think newer versions of wine use the binfmts support in the kernel to add a hook for the .exe format.
[04:07] <nova> anyone else having problems with gutsy saving their res?
[04:07] <hwilde> deCon, apt-get reinstall gnome-panel
[04:07] <winkman> Ttech: I can try? I"ve just hit reinstall (using synaptic) and it's still having the same issue
[04:07] <mib_N0JHFEJl> nova: I love you man....
[04:07] <polywaffle> chessdb is the current replacement to SCID, the chess database program for linux.  Wondering if anyone is going to make a deb file for installation of this software as it is the most functional current successor to SCID
[04:07] <SeveredCross> If it doesn't run fine when you double-click, then open a terminal, cd to wherever you downloaded iTunes setup and run wine iTunes-Setup-Filename.exe.
[04:07] <paradox> Question: I've got a WD Passport external hard drive that is (only intermitently) being recognized by my xubuntu install. How do I stop it so that I can disconnect it?

[04:07] <poningru> deCon: do alt+f2
[04:07] <nova> mib_NOJHFEJL: love ya too dude
[04:08] <haymaker> ok, now i gotta make this wifi card work and i'm set on my new laptop
[04:08] <SeveredCross> paradox: Right-click and hit Eject or Unmount?
[04:08] <poningru> deCon: now type in gnome-terminal
[04:08] <speeddemon8803> right click it and click unmount pradox
[04:08] <sethk> deCon, one easy thing you can do is delete the gnome state directory under your home directory.  That will return you to the way things were the first time you ran the desktop
[04:08] <polywaffle> anyone with into on chessdb?
[04:08] <sethk> deCon, of course, you'll lose any changes or additions you made after that point.
[04:08] <paradox> Thank you Severed Cross. I can't believe I didn't see that.
[04:08] <deCon> ponigru did that ....doesn't show my bars yet
[04:09] <polywaffle> guess im gonna have to learn to make deb installation files
[04:09] <deCon> sethk how do i navigate if i can't see my desktop?
[04:09] <winkman> Ttech: any further ideas? I can give apt a go... just tell me what to do?
[04:09] <sethk> deCon, I didn't suggest that you navigate if you can't see your desktop.
[04:09] <poningru> deCon: now type in killall gnome-panel
[04:09] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx,  I'm using NmapFE using the defaults as SYN Stealth Scan, OS detection and all ports. It says host seems down.  I can ping it from a terminal.SoI don't understand.
[04:09] <sethk> deCon, what you probably mean is how do you get to a console?
[04:10] <deCon> poningru: kk is that what i have to do everytime? is F9 or a mouse 3 connected to this by default somehow?
[04:10] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt: maybe the host is rejectin the nmap scan using iptables so that's why you cant see any ports open or like it says, the host seems down
[04:10] <paradox> question: how come I wasn't able to see my external HD in /mnt or /tmp/media in xubuntu?
[04:11] <crush_groove> crdlb, .. ty vm ..anyway you can tell me in a snapshot how you knew whart that was ,, just experience or is a glxfb issue always the vidcard and I can reset it by reconfiging x?
[04:11] <sethk> paradox, because it will be in /media
[04:11] <speeddemon8803> paradox: there is a multitude of answers to that question, all kinds of different possibilities.

[04:16] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, no only on the lan side. Hopefully that is closed on the wan side.
[04:16] <sheng> can anyone tell me what is wrong? i can't get wine to open itunes after installation
[04:16] <LinuxEzGer8> What is the point of md5?
[04:16] <bazhang> check that link LinuxEzGer8
[04:16] <fannagoganna> but is there a way with the standard CD, to choose the X server to use vesa?
[04:16] <nickrud> Nemesis02, try sudo aptitude install tzdata locales
[04:16] <speeddemon8803> !anyone
[04:16] <ubotu> A large amount of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..."  Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out?
[04:16] <j1solutions> LinuxEZ: you can confirm that your file is intact after your download
[04:17] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, I'll try to connect to it though
[04:17] <ushimitsudoki> fannagoganna: I don't know about that. When I tried to install from the regular CD, I only got a blank screen, so I never got that far on the regular install method.
[04:17] <haymaker> ok, i installed ubuntu from a flash drive because i have no cdrom for this laptop.  now i need to make synaptic and apt work, cause they think it is a cdrom, so my source media /cdrom/ when it tries to install.  how can i tell it to use /disk/ or something
[04:17] <RoAkSoAx> Joe_Dirt: if you can access a shell into that host, do an nmap localhost and that way it will show the open ports, because that hosts seems to be rejecting packets from wan side and that's why it shows host seems down, it is a security measure
[04:17] <LinuxEzGer8> "Just download the two files from any of the mirrors. Store them in the same directory." ...
[04:17] <fannagoganna> ok, will just install in text mode
[04:17] <LinuxEzGer8> What mirrors?
[04:17] <Guest10108408> Hello, everyone.
[04:17] <fannagoganna> it's a horrible pain though
[04:17] <AzureLight> Does anyone use the program Stellarium? Does it usually run at a very low (0.05) framerate?
=== Guest10108408 is now known as HolyAvenger
[04:17] <filmgeek> noob help - I'm lost on getting my usb harddrive visible to the rest of my network.
[04:17] <shawkins> Hello!
[04:17] <sheng> is there a way of opeing up itunes now that it is installed?
[04:18] <speeddemon8803> AzureLight, I do..and it does.
[04:18] <twobits> linux newbie here
[04:18] <speeddemon8803> I thought it was just me :)
[04:18] <HolyAvenger> I'm new to this world of Linux (I'm actually running Debian, but most of it is exactly the same)
[04:18] <Joe_Dirt> RoAkSoAx, Sounds good,I'll give it a try.
[04:18] <bazhang> haymaker: you have a net connection for this machine? you need to disable the install media as a source in synaptic
[04:18] <j1solutions> hello twobits
[04:18] <twobits> looking to install linux for the first time
[04:18] <AzureLight> And what about Frets on Fire? It runs REALLY slow for me
[04:18] <ushimitsudoki> fannagogana: I am a newbie, and this is my first install, so it is quite possible someone else may have better advice. Just giving you my experience
[04:18] <HolyAvenger> And the debian channel I used to go to, died. =(
[04:18] <LinuxEzGer8> I'm really starting to get frustrated.  I'm approaching the 24 hour mark of trying to get this set-up.  XP is looking more and more attractive...
[04:18] <fannagoganna> oh ok
[04:18] <sethk> fannagoganna, you can use a kernel argument to override the default driver choice.  Help at the boot prompt should have some info about that.
[04:18] <speeddemon8803> I have no clue about that one.
[04:18] <fannagoganna> all righty, will do
[04:18] <HolyAvenger> Does anyone know how can I check which program or service is using a certain port?
[04:18] <haymaker> bazhang, not until i can get ndiswrapper installed...
[04:18] <christos> im using a x1300 video card in 7.10 and cant get the desktop effects to run and it says that there is no composite extension available even with the restricted drivers activated
[04:19] <irreducibilis> AzureLight: Frets on Fire is AWESOME :)
[04:19] <j1solutions> LinuxEzGer8: get yourself a good disk and you'll be happy
[04:19] <fannagoganna> that's what i was wondering -- if anyone remembered the args. I'll just type F2 or F3 and see what goes down :)
[04:19] <nickrud> !xgl | christos
[04:19] <ubotu> christos: Compiz (compositing window manager) and XGL (X server architecture layered on top of OpenGL) - Howto at http://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager - help in #compiz-fusion
[04:19] <LinuxEzGer8> I've burned the iso twice.
[04:19] <AzureLight> Yeah, except for the fact that it lags too much for me to even hit the notes :(
[04:19] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, if xp does what you need with fewer problems, then by all means use xp.  The computer is just a tool.
[04:19] <AzureLight> I think there's a problem with my graphics card
[04:19] <LinuxEzGer8> it's about to be a flying tool.
[04:19] <twobits> I have a few questions, like whats a decent size for an ubuntu partition? And when I download the website, if I indicate that I use a 64 bit archtecture, is that the version it downloads, or is that for statistical reasons.
[04:19] <irreducibilis> I use a FX5500, what do you have?
[04:19] <LinuxEzGer8> I hate XP
[04:19] <nickrud> christos, hrm, not very helpful. you need to run fglrxinfo , make sure it's using ati mesa , then install xserver-xgl and restart X
[04:19] <ogre> how do i add a shortcut for nm-applet to my <system  folder?
[04:19] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: if the md5 sum doesn't match, you can burn it ten times and it wont matter
[04:19] <j1solutions> LinuxEzGer8: download it again, and verify the MD5 sum, then burn it again
[04:19] <AzureLight> But I have no idea how to check if I have a problem or not
[04:19] <twobits> I wish it would just say download 32 bit version or download 64 bit
[04:19] <HolyAvenger> Does anyone know how can I check which program or service is using a certain port?
[04:20] <speeddemon8803> 4GB+ is a good partition size twobits
[04:20] <irreducibilis> I am fairly experianced with FoF's workings...
[04:20] <Cubexombi> can somone help with a little bit of a video overlay issue (i believe..) evrytime a full screen video or screen saver comes on, any text entry boxes among various other elements show as visual hiccups.. old ATI radeon, using open-source drivers.
[04:20] <filmgeek> noob help: how do I share a drive on my network?
[04:20] <LinuxEzGer8> "Just download the two files from any of the mirrors. Store them in the same directory."  First instructions on verifying.  What mirrors?
[04:20] <Nemesis02> nickrud, same error.  not going away.
[04:20] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, netstat -tlp
[04:20] <AzureLight> Well, FoF runs really slow, even when it's the only program running and I've set all my settings to low
[04:20] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, erm, prepend sudo on that
[04:20] <christop1er> How do I delete an auto login in irssi?
[04:20] <HolyAvenger> Thank you
[04:20] <nickrud> Nemesis02, a sec
[04:20] <doorknob60> whats FoF?
[04:20] <HolyAvenger> I'll try right now
[04:20] <AzureLight> Frets on Fire
[04:21] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: that question meant for me? to get someone's attention use their nick to highlight them
[04:21] <doorknob60> whats that?
[04:21] <LinuxEzGer8> Bazhang: yes
[04:21] <irreducibilis> doorknob60: An excellent Guitar hero clone that is open source
[04:21] <AzureLight> A Guitar Hero-like game
[04:21] <nickrud> Nemesis02, what version of ubuntu are your running, you said you did a full upgrade? Was that from one version to another?
[04:21] <earlmred> is there a program like cpu-z for linux? i'm trying to find out what busspeed my memory is running at
[04:21] <DipsetSkateHxc> I have partitioned my maxtor 300gb hard drive using mac os x.  I made a live cd for my ibook g4, and proceeded to boot into ubuntu.  My problem is that I am unable to install ubuntu on the preveiously partitioned hard drive
[04:21] <doorknob60> oooooh o love guitar hero
[04:21] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, one of the files should be called .iso.  That is the one you burn to the cd.
[04:21] <HolyAvenger> Nickrud: AWESOME! THANK YOU!
[04:21] <twobits> also, are there significant downsides to using the 64 bit version of ubuntu?
[04:21] <doorknob60> is FoF in repos?
[04:21] <irreducibilis> I can do Monkey Wrench on Expert using only my keyboard...
[04:21] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, the other should be a short text file with only one line which has the md5 checksum of the iso file.
[04:21] <crush_groove>  once you are root . how do you cancel it without shutting term ?
[04:21] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk: I have it on my desktop.  DLed it from the website.  Burned it twice (once as fast as possible, the next time at 4x)
[04:21] <AzureLight> doorknob60: Yeah, it's in repos.
[04:21] <ivan> twobits: not really, i've been using getlibs to get 32-bit libs
[04:21] <doorknob60> sweet
[04:21] <ivan> but i run it on a server
[04:21] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: the same place you download the iso from has a md5 to match that iso--download that as well then check from it upon download of the iso
[04:22] <DipsetSkateHxc> If anyone could help me with this, that would be awesome
[04:22] <doorknob60> *opens terminal and types sudo ap....."
[04:22] <LinuxEzGer8> ah
[04:22] <LinuxEzGer8> ok
[04:22] <interceptor> Hello
[04:22] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, but how did you burn it?  Burning an iso image is different than backing up files to a cd.
[04:22] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: same mirror means same download source
[04:22] <interceptor> ladies and gentlemans
[04:22] <sheng> help me plz. i can't get wine to open up itunes, and that means my ipod is wasted
[04:22] <AzureLight> irreducibilis: Any idea why my FoF is running really slow? Even with my settings turned way down?
[04:22] <ogre> can someone tell me how to add stuff to <system on my panel?
[04:22] <ogre> plleeeaassee
[04:22] <speeddemon8803> sethk, right click the image and click burn to cd I believe it says
[04:22] <bazhang> ogre: right click add
[04:22] <sethk> speeddemon8803, depends on what program you are using to burn it.
[04:22] <doorknob60> yay installing FoF as we speak
[04:23] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  I used the default CD/DVD Writer
[04:23] <irreducibilis> AzureLight: What are your full specs?
[04:23] <interceptor> i wanted to ask which prog do i need to upgrade my Feisty to Gutsy
[04:23] <ogre> bazhang:  went back to gnome ;P
[04:23] <sethk> linux4me, you may have copied the file to the cd, rather than burning the iso image to the cd.  I know it's a bit confusing but it won't work unless you burn it as an image.
[04:23] <sethk> linux4me, sorry, not you, tab completion ...
[04:23] <robdig> ogre: system->preferences->main menu

[04:23] <ubotu> interceptor: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[04:23] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, , you may have copied the file to the cd, rather than burning the iso image to the cd.  I know it's a bit confusing but it won't work unless you burn it as an image.
[04:24] <AzureLight> irreducibilis: Any quick way to check them? All I know is I have an ATI Radeon X600 and 1 GB of RAM
[04:24] <Nemesis02> nickrud, check your PMs
[04:24] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk:  Ah.  How does one do that?
[04:24] <nickrud> interceptor, update-manager -c
[04:24] <rainwalker> AntiStaff has invited rainwalker@irc.freenode.com to the chat room #SecuWEP
[04:24] <rainwalker> what does that mean?
[04:24] <doorknob60> Azurelight what fps do you get in glxgears?
[04:24] <nickrud> Nemesis02, don't see it, you have to be registered with freenode to send pms
[04:24] <speeddemon8803> someone invited you to go to another room on this network
[04:24] <Nemesis02> nickrud, o ok.
[04:24] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, in windows, I don't exactly know, but it definitely can be done.  I always transfer an iso image to a linux box and use cdrecord to burn it.
[04:24] <interceptor> thankz
[04:24] <Nemesis02> nickrud, http://pastebin.com/d6eee9eef
[04:24] <AzureLight> doorknob60: What's glxgears?
[04:25] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it's so much easier than trying to convince windows to do what you want.
[04:25] <DipsetSkateHxc> I am completely new to ubuntu. I need some major help!!
[04:25] <rainwalker> speeddemon8803: it happens every time I enter this room
[04:25] <doorknob60> open a terminal and type in glxgears
[04:25] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Windows?  I'm so not using windows.  :D  I found a blank CD-RW that I've been using.  Do I need to DL another program to burn it properly?
[04:25] <rainwalker> DipsetSkateHxc: what do you need help with?
[04:25] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, no
[04:25] <speeddemon8803> hmmm..dunno...as long as they aren't causing trouble in room I see no problems :)
[04:25] <irreducibilis> AzureLight: Thats strange... I have only 512MB and it works fine...
[04:25] <DipsetSkateHxc> Actually installing ubuntu on my external hard drive
[04:25] <AzureLight> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:25] <AzureLight> 3725 frames in 5.1 seconds = 732.748 FPS
[04:25] <interceptor> what a pity it's not installed
[04:25] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, are you running on your 32 bit install?
[04:25] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk:  Does the default CD/DVD Writer burn?
[04:25] <rodneykk> i pooped a tape recorder
[04:26] <doorknob60> hmm 732 fps aint that good
[04:26] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk: Currently yes
[04:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, yes
[04:26] <irreducibilis> Along with Pentium IV 1500 Mhz and a Nvidia 5500
[04:26] <doorknob60> i get over 2000 and my vid card isnt that great
[04:26] <nickrud> Nemesis02, you have several issues, but to start, make sure you have no sources other than ubuntu ones installed. Then run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:26] <Cubexombi> <doorknob60> better than my 430
[04:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it's normally intelligent enough to do the right thing.
[04:26] <doorknob60> somethings probly wrong with ur drivers
[04:26] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk:  are there settings I need to manipulate for it?
[04:26] <AzureLight> And what's with that first output?
[04:26] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: if you choose open with cd/dvd creator
[04:26] <AzureLight> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:26] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang:  that's what I've been doing
[04:26] <DipsetSkateHxc> I try to install it on a previously partitioned hdd and it tells me there is no root file system.  So i dont knwo what to do after that
[04:26] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, it may be that there are problems associated with using a cd/rw instead of a cd/r.
[04:26] <AzureLight> Something is wrong with my drivers
[04:27] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, I'll give you the command I use to burn (from a terminal window):
[04:27] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: then it may be the media; do you have a blank cdr you can try it on?
[04:27] <irreducibilis> Could someone compare the Nvidia Fx5500's specs with the ATI x600?
[04:27] <irreducibilis> I am not famillier with ATI cards
[04:27] <LinuxEzGer8> sethk:  I'll look.
[04:27] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang:  I'll look
[04:27] <Nemesis02> nickrud, i can't do dist-upgrade till i fix the issue with tzdata affecting apt-get
[04:27] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, cdrecord -vv whatever.iso
[04:27] <nickrud> Nemesis02, true, doh
[04:27] <ogre> bazhang: what im trying to do is get rid of all panels & just run everything off AWN the only thing i need is to get a working nm-applet in my <system folder
[04:28] <doorknob60> i can run glxgears inside konversation in the konsole tab on my fx5200 in a sec
[04:28] <doorknob60> as soon as FoF is done installing
[04:28] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, whatever.iso being the file you downloaded.  The -vv isn't necessary but gives you lots of info while it's burning, so use it.
[04:28] <bazhang> most of the problems with a bad iso burn have to do with either a)bad media b)burn speed or c)not matched md5 sum LinuxEzGer8
[04:28] <Jay-Oh-En> whats the name of the program to unrar files in ubuntu
[04:28] <doorknob60> i just use winrar in wine lol
[04:28] <bazhang> ogre: not sure--kde user here :}
[04:28] <AzureLight> Oops
[04:29] <AzureLight> Didn't mean to exit Pidgin
[04:29] <nickrud> Nemesis02, sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite /var/cache/apt/archives/tzdata<tab>
[04:29] <sherl0ck> Jay-Oh-En, unrar
[04:29] <Jay-Oh-En> sherl0ck: does it have a gui
[04:29] <sherl0ck> so im looking to get involved more in ubuntu, where should i begin??
[04:29] <nickrud> Nemesis02, did you just do an upgrade from one version to another?
[04:29] <Nemesis02> nickrude, option -i is unknown
[04:29] <speeddemon8803> involved how?
[04:29] <doorknob60> rofl i just did glxgearas and got 58 fps :P
[04:29] <speeddemon8803> helping?
[04:30] <doorknob60> i have waaaay too many progs running
[04:30] <bazhang> Jay-Oh-En: just clicking on the first file in a rar archive will put it back to gether
[04:30] <ogre> ok guys, what im trying to do is get rid of all panels & just run everything off AWN the only thing i need is to get a working nm-applet in my <system folder. can anyone tell me how?
[04:30] <AzureLight> Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
[04:30] <AzureLight> 4723 frames in 5.1 seconds = 930.765 FPS
[04:30] <AzureLight> My FPS is going up now
[04:30] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, i did an upgrade from dapper to edgy, but what affected it was install libapache2-fastcgi from the debian repository.
[04:30] <Jay-Oh-En> bazhang: ?
[04:30] <crush_groove> ogre ,.. why not just use fluxbox is you want a clean dt?
[04:30] <sherl0ck> Jay-Oh-En, u want file-roller
[04:30] <irreducibilis> I wonder how much help I can be though... I run all my games in Windows
[04:30] <AzureLight> But that first output tells me something
[04:30] <Jay-Oh-En> sherl0ck: perfect thats what i was looking for
[04:31] <Cubexombi> AzureLight, it tels me that even with broken drivers your's still works better than mine
[04:31] <LinuxEzGer8> I do believe the disc is too small
[04:31] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, i was trying to install ispcp omega, a webhosting control panel that's the offshoot of VHCS.
[04:31] <nickrud> Nemesis02, oh, did you read what I said about repositories other than ubuntu above? REMOVE them, apt-get update, and try again
[04:31] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk: if the iso is 696mb and the disk is a 700mb disc, is that too small?
[04:31] <Nemesis02> nickrud, yes i did.
[04:31] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: if it is a cdrw it may have other stuff still on it
[04:31] <soldats> no
[04:31] <AzureLight> Does anyone know what " Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0"." means?
[04:31] <irreducibilis> LinuxEzGer8: 696 < 700
[04:32] <nickrud> Nemesis02, ok, and dpkg -i is one of the fundamental commands, used it many times
[04:32] <sethk> LinuxEzGer8, might be a problem, yes.  You should run a blank on it first.
[04:32] <Cubexombi> AzureLight: What Vid card you got?
=== NETabuse is now known as NET||abuse
[04:32] <doorknob60> there i closed programs and got 1686 fps in glxgears on my geforce fx5200
[04:32] <doorknob60> lol compared to 58 with progs open
[04:32] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: ATI Radeon X600
[04:32] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, "E: Command line option 'i' [from -i] is not known."
[04:32] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang: it does. It had the previous copy of the iso, however when I tried to do the cdrecord, it didn't record.  It filled the screen with stuff and went right back to the cursor.
=== Ashfire is now known as Ashfire908
[04:32] <Nemesis02> nickrud, woops my bad
[04:33] <Cubexombi> AzureLight: can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
[04:33] <nickrud> Nemesis02,  ;)
[04:33] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: Uh... how exactly?
[04:33] <bazhang> LinuxEzGer8: I've created plenty of drink coasters in burning iso files--you may want to get a stack of cdrs handy :}
=== malakhi_ is now known as malakhi
[04:33] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, yeah, didn't see it also copied and pasted sudo apt-get in front also lol.
[04:33] <tanker_> is any body taking to me ?
[04:33] <LinuxEzGer8> bazhang:  Guess it's unavoidable.  PJs coming off, jeans going on.  To the store with me.
[04:33] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: are you sure your null cdr is null?
[04:33] <bazhang> tanker_: not sure--should we be? :}
[04:34] <Cubexombi> you can alt-F2 and "gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" then go to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org and paste it there..
[04:34] <Nemesis02> Nickrud, thanks that fixed the problem, you were a lot of help :)
[04:34] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie:  eh?
[04:34] <crush_groove> how do you clear history in term ?
[04:35] <bazhang> tanker_: if you have a question--ask away :}
[04:35] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: what is "eh" mean....
[04:35] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: I didn't understand
[04:35] <tanker_> ok,
[04:35] <Berto> Is anyone else's flashplugin32 working badly after the update?
[04:35] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: oh
[04:35] <AzureLight> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48502/
[04:35] <crush_groove> mine in konq Berto
[04:35] <Farquad> i have a dumb question, everytime my computer starts i have to run this command ($ORACLE_HOME/bin/isqlpluscti start) .. how can i get this command to run when my computer starts?
[04:35] <HolyAvenger> I have some issues which, I believe, are related to GNOME (or X). I installed x window and Xfce. Everything was working perfectly fine
[04:35] <crimsun> known issue on amd64.
[04:35] <nickrud> Nemesis02, you probably still have some mixed debian packages in your system, the origins button in synaptic will let you check
[04:35] <HolyAvenger> then I uninstalled xfce and installed Gnome
[04:35] <tanker_> it's nice ,
[04:35] <bazhang> Berto: that should be fixed now--plenty of folks were having problems with that :}
[04:35] <Cubexombi> <Berto> depends what you mean.. My audio skips like a scratched CD
[04:35] <HolyAvenger> now Most windows won't load
[04:36] <LinuxEzGer8> Sethk:  Is it possible to create a second partition with my LiveCD, DL the ISO on that partition, then install it to the first partition and then remove the second?
[04:36] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: i say are you sure your cdr is in the null condition?
[04:36] <HolyAvenger> the default internet explorer wont open
[04:36] <Cygnet> I have a question: If I were to install a new video card in this computer (which has intel integrated graphics) how would I go about telling the computer to use the new card and/or disable the intel graphics?
[04:36] <Berto> bazhang, where would i get that fix?  is there a forum topic
[04:36] <HolyAvenger> and many other windows do not work at all
[04:36] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie:  it's a CD-RW
[04:36] <HolyAvenger> (they just wont open)
[04:36] <rainwalker> bazhang: I pm'ed you
[04:36] <bazhang> !flash | Berto
[04:36] <ubotu> Berto: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - Flash 9 is now available in dapper-backports and edgy-backports - See also !Restricted and !Gnash
[04:36] <Cubexombi> Cygnet - if you're lucky you're bios shuld have an option to disable it
[04:36] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: then you have to clean it first
[04:37] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: define clean it
[04:37] <ronnie> Orz.
[04:37] <ogre> crush_groove:  because I have all my gnome still its just sitting in awn
[04:37] <Cygnet> maybe I should get into the bios and see, then
[04:37] <Berto> bazhang, i already had flash working, and it still works.  I just got an ubuntu update today that makes it more unstable
[04:37] <Cygnet> what if I'm not lucky?
[04:37] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie:  Do I need to format it?  If so, how does one format in Ubuntu?
[04:37] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48502/
[04:37] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: not format just need clean
[04:37] <twobits> will i have to parition my harddrive myself, or does the installer come with the necessary tools
[04:37] <HolyAvenger> I have some issues which, I believe, are related to GNOME (or X). I installed x window and Xfce. Everything was working perfectly fine, then I uninstalled xfce and installed Gnome and now most windows won't load, the default internet explorer wont open and many other windows do not work at all (they just wont open)
[04:38] <twobits> when i install it
[04:38] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: as in, erase everything on it?
[04:38] <Cubexombi> Cygnet.. well you may luck out and have a PC that plays nice with 2 cards, some disable it once it's detected, mine doesn't and I hget a kernel panic at boot
[04:38] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: are you useing the nero buner?
[04:38] <LinuxEzGer8> ronnie: no

[04:38] <bazhang> hes using the cd/dvd creator ronnie
[04:38] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, how did you install gnome?
[04:38] <HolyAvenger> apt-get install gnome.
[04:39] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: i know nero can do that
[04:39] <DipsetSkateHxc> ?
[04:39] <Wing> Is there any easy way to reload the environment variables from /etc/environment without restarting the damned system?
[04:39] <Cygnet> I'll have to reboot and check what's in my bios then, thanks all
[04:39] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, hm, try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[04:40] <earlmred> is there any way from linux to view what frequence memory is running at?
[04:40] <LinuxEzGer8> well, thanks for your help all.  I'm at 21 hours, 40 minutes of trying to get it to work and I give up.  I'll buy 1,000 CD-Rs tomorrow and try them.  Goodnight.
[04:41] <HolyAvenger> nickrud: I'm on Debian (ubuntu comes from it, as you might already know far better than me) and the #Debian channel (and server) died, so I came here hoping it could be solveable
[04:41] <bazhang> see you tomorrow LinuxEzGer8
[04:41] <Jay-Oh-En> how do i make kubuntu start up in silent mode everytime
[04:41] <Wing> HolyAvenger: #debian is still there.
[04:42] <Wing> HolyAvenger: /join #debian
[04:42] <nickrud> HolyAvenger, ah, I used to run sid and gnome was often broken from packages being out of sync, is that what you are running?
[04:42] <HolyAvenger> in this server? =S
[04:42] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> you don't happen to have a wacom tablet do you?
[04:42] <ronnie> LinuxEzGer8: you are so dilligent...
[04:42] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, with an argument on the kernel command line in the grub configuration file.
[04:42] <Wing> HolyAvenger: This server is just an alias to the Freenode network.
[04:42] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: Nope, not at all. O_o
[04:42] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: could you help me?
[04:42] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> K, just trimming the fat on the xorg.conf
[04:43] <Jack_Sparrow> sethk: Dont you EVER sleep? ...  :)
[04:43] <sethk> Jack_Sparrow, sure, but I can answer questions while I'm sleeping  :)
[04:43] <Farquad> everytime my computer starts i have to run this command ($ORACLE_HOME/bin/isqlpluscti start) .. how can i get this command to run when my computer starts?
[04:43] <Jack_Sparrow> sethk: that explains alot
[04:43] <ogre> ok guys, what im trying to do is get rid of all panels & just run everything off AWN the only thing i need is to get a working nm-applet in my <system folder. can anyone tell me how?
[04:43] <sethk> Farquad, add it to /etc/rc.local
[04:43] <doorknob60> frets on fire doesnt work to well on my comp either....
[04:44] <Farquad> thanks
[04:44] <sethk> Jack_Sparrow, hmm., I'm not sure how to take that  :)
[04:44] <doorknob60> and i got over 2600 fps on glxgears
[04:44] <AzureLight> Doorknob60: really slow?
[04:44] <doorknob60> ya
[04:44] <AzureLight> Odd...
[04:44] <doorknob60> and i got 1.5gb ram
[04:44] <nickrud> old people need less sleep
[04:44] <AzureLight> Ugh... so this is more complicated than is seems
[04:44] <doorknob60> and the lights shine down and arent very transparent and its hard to see the notwes
[04:44] <doorknob60> i suck at it even though i own at GH3 on my ps2
[04:45] <Cygnet> in my bios under video options I've got "primary video adapter <auto>", is that what I'm looking for? (to switch video from intel graphics to new card)
[04:45] <AzureLight> Mine is just REALLY laggy and the notes need to be hit before they even reach the line
[04:45] <AzureLight> Sound is fine though
[04:45] <doorknob60> mines pretty laggy, especially considering my specs
[04:45] <AzureLight> Lower your settings
[04:45] <nickrud> Cygnet, sounds right, should be an option to say pci card, not onboard
[04:46] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: i guess not eh
[04:46] <doorknob60> i lowered mine a lot
[04:46] <sethk> Cygnet, better to explicitly turn it off.
[04:46] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, sorry, I didn't even see your question.
[04:46] <Cygnet> I don't have any options other than auto right now since I haven't obtained nor installed any new cards yet
[04:46] <AzureLight> doorknow60: Set the FoF settings to the lowest you can and see if it's still slow
[04:47] <sethk> Cygnet, ok.  Auto should do what you need (turn it off if another is present), but personally I'd install the new card and then go back in the bios and set the on board video to off.
[04:47] <doorknob60> i set em to lowest except framerate
[04:47] <AzureLight> Hmm
[04:47] <doorknob60> cuz i dont want 1 frame per second :P
[04:47] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: could you help me... do what im trying to do?
[04:47] <AzureLight> Same here, and mine still doesn't work
[04:47] <Jack_Sparrow> Not trying to run fof under wine or anything like that right
[04:47] <Xacarith> Having an issue with packet manager getting to the internet. or something.  Might have something to do with lack of internet connection when installing.
[04:47] <irreducibilis> doorknob60: Frets on Fire looks like crap anyways until you mod it to look like GH
[04:47] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, well, I don't know until you tell me what you are trying to do.
[04:47] <doorknob60> no i dloaded from repos
[04:47] <Cygnet> sethk, ok, thanks :)
[04:48] <AzureLight> I had problems with the repos one
[04:48] <irreducibilis> I have 4 mods that change the notes, backround, fretboard/neck, score counter, etc...
[04:48] <doorknob60> irred:well no point in modding it if it doesnt work right :P
[04:48] <AzureLight> The repos one wouldn't play for me
[04:48] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: to make every startup in silent mode and change the bootsplash screen background
[04:48] <AzureLight> I'd get list index out of range
[04:48] <irreducibilis> I got mine from SourceForge...
[04:48] <Rodri> hola
[04:48] <doorknob60> the repos one played for me but not too well
[04:48] <AzureLight> Same
[04:48] <Rodri> alguien que me pueda orentar
[04:48] <doorknob60> ill try the SF one then
[04:49] <mikedoty> How can I change my desktop resolution in KDE?  I've looked at all of the options, but I don't see anywhere that would let me change it.

[04:49] <irreducibilis> Woops.
[04:49] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, There is a quiet argument (on the kernel command line) to turn off most things.  There is another one for complete silence; let me see if I can find it.
[04:49] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/48503/plain/  --> I've added a few options and switches, I'd recommend doing a back-up of your current xorg.conf <in terminal "sudo cd /etx/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup" > then "gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf" and paste the new xorg over the old. and restart x.
[04:49] <Xacarith> using apt-get update all I get is Reading package lists... Done
[04:49] <Rodri> no se como
[04:50] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: that is all that command does
[04:50] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: i meant so it shows all those text lines on startup i  think its called verbose?
[04:50] <Jack_Sparrow> Rodri: solamente engles
[04:50] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: Alright
[04:50] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, now I'm confused.  You want the lines, or you don't want the lines?
[04:50] <Xacarith> On this computer I get a list of packets it checks
[04:50] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: i do
[04:50] <mikedoty> Rodri:  Necesitas entrar "/join #ubuntu-es", por ejemplo
[04:51] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk:  i want the lines
[04:51] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, ok, go into /boot/grub/menu.lst and remove quiet, both on the kernel line and on a line by itself.
[04:51] <doorknob60> just wondering, what IRC programs do u guys use? i use konversation cuz it owns even though i use gnome
[04:51] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: are you trying to upgrade?
[04:51] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: lol wtf "sudo: cd: command not found"
[04:51] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thats all?
[04:51] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, yes.  The lines will also be written to /var/log/messages
[04:51] <Cubexombi> <AzureLight> my goof typo
[04:51] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow My other computer comes up with a list of packets checked  Also update manager doesn't come up with any updates, saying my system is up to date.  When I installed from the same CD on this computer I had like 100+
[04:51] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, you can repeat the startup lines with the dmesg command
[04:52] <Cubexombi> sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[04:52] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, although dmesg has a limited buffer size so old messages are eventually lost as new ones appear.
[04:52] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: are the repos set the same on both?
[04:52] <Reilithion> What command will show me what programs are listening on what ports?
[04:52] <Xacarith> Also the only packets synaptic is loading in is the ones already installed
[04:52] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, but immediately after boot, do:    dmesg > captured-dmesg      to preserve the messages.
[04:52] <Cubexombi> AzureLight sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup
[04:52] <Jay-Oh-En> seth i mean like this on startup http://kde-look.org/CONTENT/content-pre1/26409-1.jpg
[04:53] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow Repos?
[04:53] <Jack_Sparrow> !repos
[04:53] <ubotu> The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/components - See also !EasySource
[04:53] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: and ill pastebin my grub and you edit it k please :)
[04:53] <AzureLight> cubexombi: Alright, done, now how do I restart x? XD
[04:53] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: Perhaps, just explain what you are trying to do or install
[04:53] <Jay-Oh-En> AzureLight: cntrl alt backspace
[04:53] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, you change it, paste it, and we'll tell you whether or not it's correct.
[04:54] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow I'm trying to bothy update the system and install other programs, like xchat
=== hotma is now known as ayu_18_kul
[04:54] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: did you look at that image
[04:54] <Cubexombi> ctrl+alt+backspace.. if it doesn't restart, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[04:54] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, looking
[04:54] <winkman> Hi, i'm just about to wipe my ubuntu system for a complete re-installation- i've used APTonCd to get all the packages, copied over all of my home folder onto my flash drive- would you recommend me doing anything else?
[04:55] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: installing xchat etc is easy.. but please define update the system?
[04:55] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thats what i want it to look like on startup
[04:55] <Cubexombi> Azurelight if it doesn't restart, sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf will restore your current config
[04:55] <tianshu> Hello? Is Ereryone here?
[04:55] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: You might want to look at synaptic for your package management and enabling the extra repos.
[04:55] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow Your usual OS updates
[04:55] <AzureLight> Cubexombi: I got some warning box saying ubuntu is running in now graphics mode, and now I have a smaller resolution
[04:55] <tianshu> do you know chinese?
[04:56] <nickrud> winkman, sounds like a plan, I'm assuming you're gonna have a home partition on this next install?
[04:56] <tianshu> 有中国的么？
[04:56] <nickrud> !cn | tianshu
[04:56] <ubotu> tianshu: For Ubuntu help in Chinese 您可以访问中文频道： #ubuntu-cn 或者 #ubuntu-tw  或者 #ubuntu-hk
[04:56] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, The startup scripts for ubuntu and gentoo are rather different.  It is not trivial to get exactly the same display.
[04:56] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, if you prefer the gentoo style, why not just run gentoo?
[04:56] <Cubexombi> AzureLight Hmm..  tahts a little odd I didn't mess with your resolutions.
[04:56] <Xacarith> jack_sparrow I have been just using synaptic packet manager to install xchat...  But when I search for it on the laptop nothing comes up.
[04:56] <tianshu> 有懂中文的么？
[04:56] <winkman> nickrud: I'll have the same setup, things have stuffed up with one of my latest updates - (my keyboard is majorly stuffing up in firefox, and speed has dramatically reduced)
[04:57] <wy> tianshu: me. But I can't input chinese right now
[04:57] <Cubexombi> Azurelight you can sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf will restore your old config.
[04:57] <Jack_Sparrow> !info xchat
[04:57] <ubotu> xchat: IRC client for X similar to AmIRC. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.8.4-0ubuntu5 (gutsy), package size 300 kB, installed size 808 kB
[04:57] <nickrud> Xacarith, system->admin->software sources, make sure the first four are ticked, and the cd is not
[04:57] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: well i dont like gentoo and i know you can do this in kubuntu and ubuntu usually you press a key to make it like this on startup to see what things fail BUT i want it like this every    single    time
[04:57] <AzureLight> cubexombi: first, let me try glxgears
[04:57] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: do you have universe enabled?
[04:57] <tubetop> howdy all
[04:58] <Jack_Sparrow> Xacarith: If not... enable it ... then update   then install
[04:58] <tubetop> does ubuntu server come with a active firewall?
[04:58] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, it won't be precisely the same, although it will be close.
[04:58] <AzureLight> Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual
[04:58] <tubetop> sorry 7.10
[04:58] <AzureLight> lol
[04:58] <Jack_Sparrow> !firewall
[04:58] <ubotu> Ubuntu, like any other linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'iptables' command (see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo), or GUI applications such as Firestarter (Gnome) or Guarddog (KDE).
[04:58] <doorknob60> brb
[04:58] <winkman> Joy-Oh-En: I think this is enabled/disabled by using the 'Quiet' option in boot
[04:58] <nickrud> tubetop, no, it's not running
[04:58] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thats all i want :]
[04:58] <sethk> Jay-Oh-En, I'm trying to remember exactly where that switch is.  Hold on a few moments.
[04:58] <AzureLight> What did you do Cubexombi? XD
[04:58] <Jay-Oh-En> sethk: thanks
[04:58] <winkman> nickrud: so... this sounds ok?
[04:59] <Cubexombi> Azurelight um not enough to screw that up :) Looks like it doesn't like a few options
[04:59] <prozacmas> has anyone here installed ubuntu using an lvm ?
[04:59] <tubetop> does iptables have a line in init.d or somentin?
[04:59] <nickrud> winkman, yup, that's the basics. I have home on another partition, so I don't need the usb, but what you are doing is the same as I do (for what thats worth :)
