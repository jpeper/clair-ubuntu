[01:56] <Hadron> if so type "mount" and look at the mount properties.
[01:56] <ehc> Hadron, not off the top of my head. but I could look it up. I want it to automatically  allow my user to read it.
[01:56] <patrlck> I tried mount -o remount,rw / but I get this error : mount: block device /dev/disk/by-uuid/48b73949-d3f8-439b-a079-80d188753d7b is write-protected, mounting read-only
[01:56] <afaik> oh duh.. my disk was mounted, so it couldnt partition it
[01:56] <Hadron> the defaults are for "rw" for ext3. e.g UUID=7dbc023b-6777-4dc5-8bac-23c3908d00ca  /home                    ext3         defaults                            0  2
