[01:31] <puppy_parade> tomreyn, " freetype spu text error: Breaking unbreakable line" is all that appears, and that is only for VLC
[01:31] <tomreyn> Sara: you can also install the 'file' package and run the 'file' command it provides on the file in question, this will give you a mostly reliable idea of what type of file it is.
[01:31] <zykotick9> deper29: stuff yes, but what's in /etc/exports?
[01:32] <gharz> anyone?
[01:32] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: might be that you need to install !codecs

[01:33] <deper29> that is my exports
[01:33] <intelikey> tomreyn  just out of curiousity </sp>  does file still ignore .extentions when determining file type ?
[01:33] <Anonymous83n> hello
[01:33] <gharz> msdaisy: yes please... i don't want to install ubuntu using virtualbox... :(
[01:33] <puppy_parade> I have the restricted extras installed. Video works fine, for a while
[01:34] <gharz> msdaisy: a wubi installed is preferred
[01:34] <tomreyn> intelikey: i think it still ignores extensions and interprets magic bytes exlusively. but have not studied its source code.
[01:34] <zykotick9> deper29: ya, just exporting /mnt/user instead of individual directories would be a LOT easier...

[01:35] <Gwennifer> Is there a way to give myself write access to all system files? I'm really tired of having to give myself access every time :x
[01:35] <zykotick9> deper29: you should be able to get to TV Music Movies Downloads Books though
[01:35] <jrib> Gwennifer: what are you doing exactly that requires you to do that so often?
[01:35] <deper29> zykotick9: the server is actually running unRAID, and so every time I make something in the web interface that is under /mnt/user it makes a new entry automatically
[01:35] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: i think you may want to file a bug, since it's obscure enough that it's unlikely you'll find one here right now who knows the answer.
[01:36] <Sara> thanks everyone vmware is working
[01:36] <zykotick9> deper29: i have no idea what that is - and i'll be dropping out at this point.  best of luck.
[01:36] <puppy_parade> I've had someone suggest it was flash and my Radeon drivers
[01:36] <Gwennifer> jrib: My Intel graphics and monitor is poorly recognized on Ubuntu

[01:36] <msdaisy> !wubi | gharz
[01:36] <ubottu> gharz: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting. Please  file bugs at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug. For Ubuntu Oneiric/11.10 http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/wubi.exe
[01:36] <deper29> zykotick9: it's linux is all it is.
[01:36] <puppy_parade> and the Radeon drivers are still not usable.
[01:37] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: it does sound like a driver issue to me. but i'm just guessing really.
[01:37] <gharz> msdaisy: i already used wubi but i can't boot due to uefi issue with windows 8
[01:37] <Gwennifer> jrib: I fixed the problem, sort of, but I still need write access and doing sudo <texteditor> gets really, really annoying really quickly
[01:37] <zykotick9> deper29: and with that comment, i won't be seeing your posts further, good luck.
[01:37] <puppy_parade> is there a way to reset it without logging out or rebooting?
[01:37] <jrib> Gwennifer: you're not answering my question, so it's hard to suggest the best course of action for you.
[01:38] <FloodBot1> !netsplit
[01:38] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: closing and restarting the application is insufficient then?
[01:39] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: look into the xrandr command to reset your video output.
[01:40] <puppy_parade> right, I have to live with the viewable area getting a little smaller every time I want to watch a video
[01:40] <puppy_parade> It's maddenning.
[01:41] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: you can also try upgrading / downgrading drivers, and to try the open source ones (which can be a good option either in general or just to ensure it's indeed the driver that's at fault, not your hardware)
[01:42] <puppy_parade> I upgraded to 12.10 for the oss drivers
[01:42] <puppy_parade> and they were still unusable
[01:42] <puppy_parade> I like being able to use all of my monitors
[01:42] <intelikey> is there a free vmware ?
[01:43] <puppy_parade> I think they have a free version, but virtual is a great way to get into VMs intelikey

[01:55] <jsbach> jrib: I have reasons.
[01:55] <jsbach> ms-daisy: Thank you.
[01:56] <Flannel> jsbach: old-releases will work fine.  It has mirrors and isos.  You just need to be aware of that fact first.
[01:56] <jsbach> Flannel: Thanks again.
[01:56] <tomreyn> puppy_parade: and so can reporting bugs, since chances are soemeone else reported it before, your bug report will be tagged a duplicate of that, and the other bug report has a workaround or fix in it.. that's part of why i suggested you file a bug.
[01:56] <Ben64> jsbach: it also does not contain all the security fixes and could leave you vulnerable

[02:27] <She153> i meant that for franko
[02:28] <ms-daisy> You can put windows on the machine by using the windows install CDs. That will completely remove everything currently on the computer and replace it with a new windows installation She153

[02:30] <bazhang_> She153, again, not an ubuntu issue.

[02:40] <robertzaccour> Never could figure out why its so much harder to forgive myself than it is someone else.
[02:40] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: how did it fail? this would be something you should look into first of all.
[02:41] <IdleOne> robertzaccour: How is this ubuntu support related?
[02:42] <stiltzkin> If I remember correctly the updater itself crashed. It threw a lot of messages about conflicting packages (I apologize for not having specifics here, this was about a month ago) and having no way to recover the installation, I shut down the system. Now I'm just looking to see whether there's any way to get the GUI back or whether I just need to bite the bullet and reinstall.

[02:46] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: getting package conflicts fixed and installing the remaining updates can be a requirement to get your system back into a working state. you can use the "apt-get" command line utility to do it.
[02:46] <tomreyn> !apt-get > stiltzkin
[02:46] <ubottu> stiltzkin, please see my private message
[02:47] <stiltzkin> ...why are you telling me how to use apt-get?
[02:47] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: because i think you want to fix your package managemnet system and that you would probably have done so by now if you knew how to.
[02:48] <stiltzkin> There is no problem with my packages though...
[02:48] <stiltzkin> this is a driver proble
[02:48] <tomreyn> stiltzkin: for a matter of fact, your kernel version is a couple patch levels behind, so at least you don't have the latest patches. which could be a cause of the issues you're running into.
[02:49] <stiltzkin> Well yeah, it is...because as I said, the upgrade was not successful
[02:49] <stiltzkin> I mean this is not a critical issue or anything, I can always reinstall. I'm really more just curious as to what happened and if it's easier to fix than to reinstall

[02:55] <GMDynamics> @Hajime i was that sarcasm ? :D
