[08:04] <atmosx> hello, is there any reliable way to know why apache2 is installed? Probably some php module is auto-installing apache

[08:07] <mgor> atmosx, or sudo apt-cache rdepends --installed <package>
[08:07] <cart_Man> Hi everyone.. I can not seem to install device-tree-overlay in ubuntu using apt-get. IS there some special package name for it?
[08:07] <cart_Man> I used " apt-get install device-tree-overlay"
[08:07] <cart_Man> did not work

[08:09] <Peppernrino> any security risks in using 14.04.2?
[08:10] <simpsonc> Hi, is there anyone that is familiar with the i915 video driver issues with 16.04? I've attempted the fix at https://aboutsimon.com/blog/2016/07/20/Ubuntu-16.04-external-monitor-flickering-and-turning-off-on-intel-i915.html which did not correct the issue.
[08:10] <cfhowlett> Peppernrino, as opposed to the current 14.04.5 ??
[08:10] <Peppernrino> seems cuda is a little more forgiving <=14.04.2
[08:10] <Peppernrino> yeah
[08:10] <Peppernrino> entered: sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libcheese7 libcheese-gtk23 libclutter-gst-2.0-0 libcogl15 libclutter-gtk-1.0-0 libclutter-1.0-0
[08:10] <Peppernrino> and: sudo apt-get install cuda
[08:10] <Peppernrino> says cuda needs cuda...
[08:10] <Peppernrino> lol
[08:11] <Peppernrino> could it be because i installed xorg-edgers?
[08:11] <Peppernrino> i saw on a forum that it causes problems occasionally.
[08:12] <mgor> simpsonc, have you tried without psr? I had flickering issues with it enabled

[08:16] <mgor> simonf, do you have /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf? if so remove enable_psr, also check /etc/default/grub and make sure you don't have i915.enable_psr in any of the GRUB_CMDLINE... (when changing /etc/default/grub, don't forget to run sudo update-grub)

[08:35] <EriC^^> how can i convert a .mp4 to a h.263 mp4 using avconv or ffmpeg?
[08:35] <cfhowlett> EriC^^, man ffmpeg has the details

[08:38] <EriC^^> anybody know an idea how i could get this done? ultimately i want to convert a video to something supported on android

[08:40] <gattoinvestito> Eric something with scrollbars for terminal? So i can look back and forward without writing commands?
[08:40] <EriC^^> xangua: i'll do that but i also need to convert them
[08:41] <xangua> gattoinvestito: don't hexchat and other IRC clients have a black kinda terminal themes?

[08:41] <gattoinvestito> yes
[08:42] <gattoinvestito> a terminal ui ^^
[08:42] <EriC^^> gattoinvestito: you can scroll up and down with pageup i think
[08:43] <k1l> gattoinvestito: what do you need scrollbars for? irssi supports scrolling with page-up and -down anyways
