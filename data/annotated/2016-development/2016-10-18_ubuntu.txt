[00:10] <Dykotomee> I installed postfix, but I cannot send email directly from the server via a "mail" command.
[00:10] <Hell-Razor> Nobody around uses the pos rt61pci drivers?
[00:10] <Dykotomee> Postfix is working, because email from outside sources going to email aliases get forwarded to other external addresses.
[00:11] <Dykotomee> Any idea why I can autoforward email from my server, but not directly send it?

[00:16] <boomer> Good evening all! :)
[00:20] <Hell-Razor> I am shocked at how dead this channel is. Was hoping to get my wifi up and running today
[00:20] <v7_> Hell-Razor: :)
[00:21] <v7_> Hell-Razor: All of us are using you card everyday :) !
[00:21] <Hell-Razor> v7_ lies.
[00:21] <Hell-Razor> v7_ out of ideas for getting my ralink card going. Fails at the authentication stage (I think)
[00:22] <v7_> dmesg ?
[00:23] <Hell-Razor> Yeah authentication with (my router) timed out
[00:23] <paddymahoney> is anyone aware of a good way to test a dist-upgrade? I have a shitload of packages installed and there is undoubtedly many packages that will have unmet dependencies etc
[00:24] <v7_> Hell-Razor: Like this ? authentication with 92:68:c3:f4:ec:3a timed out
[00:24] <Hell-Razor> v7_ The mac displays yes but not that one.

[00:28] <v7_> pi-alex: yup
[00:29] <v7_> Hell-Razor: I've asked you for file which is in this folder ... to make sure that we could add the some lines ...
[00:29] <pi-alex> my friend put in the wrong password a ton of times in ssh
[00:29] <v7_> pi-alex: concrete

[00:35] <pi-alex> i think thats it
[00:35] <pi-alex> i see his ip
[00:35] <pi-alex> how can i unblock?
[00:36] <v7_> pi-alex: try iptables -D {ip}
[00:36] <paddymahoney> Bashing-om-thanks!

[00:43] <pi-alex> let me check
[00:44] <pi-alex> no installed
[00:44] <pi-alex> *not
[00:44] <v7_> pi-alex: There is no folder /var/lib/denyhosts ?
[00:45] <v7_> pi-alex: If you haven't a lot of time you can add his ip to file /etc/hosts.allow and let him conncet
[00:45] <pi-alex> ok
[00:45] <pi-alex> but no /var/lib/denyhosts
[00:46] <v7_> Like this: sshd : {ip}
[00:46] <v7_> pi-alex: Restart ssh
[00:46] <pi-alex> ok
[00:46] <v7_> pi-alex: sudo service sshd restart
[00:47] <pi-alex> it restarted
[00:48] <v7_> pi-alex: You know .. I don't know where we can find this ip 'cause all defaults folders and files we've checked ...

[01:15] <ub200> ok let me check

[01:23] <BusFactor1> Hi.  I've experienced the following behaviour on 3 Ubuntu based distributions over the past year.  When the system goes into screen blanking mode to power save on the monitor, after clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard causes the screen to 'flash' at about 1Hz and never returns to the desktop.  I can switch to a virtual terminal and kill the X Session.  Has anyone else had problems like this with newer Ubuntu
[01:23] <BusFactor1>  based distributions?
[01:23] <debkad> !ubuntu-sp
[01:23] <BusFactor1> I've also had problems with suspend not ever unsuspending on my MacBook Air and severe booting problems on another machine for no observable reason.
[01:24] <compdoc> BusFactor1, what sort of cable do you use to connect the monitor?
[01:24] <BusFactor1> This kind of stuff was why I used Ubuntu in the first place.
[01:24] <BusFactor1> A good quality DVI-HDMI cable
[01:25] <BusFactor1> I'm assuming the first problem is due to a driver bug since all the different distributions use different display managers
[01:25] <compdoc> that should support waking. Ive seen issues with the older 15 pin vga cables
[01:26] <compdoc> do you use sound over hdmi? is that eneabled in the bios?
[01:26] <BusFactor1> no sound over hdmi in this case, no
[01:26] <BusFactor1> it's a dvi to hdmi cable
[01:27] <BusFactor1> sorry, display port to hdmi cable
[01:30] <BusFactor1> I'm just curious about how people are finding with the qualify of ubuntu based distributions lately.
[01:37] <phenom> Has ubuntu *just* stopped allowint SUID applications within an encrypted home?

[01:58] <FreeFog> Hi , what would be the proper way of installing plasma 5.8.1 on ubuntu 16.04?
[02:03] <tksn> Ey, guys
[02:05] <Daxtir> hey I have a question about enabling ESP for IPsec can anyone help me?
[02:05] <tksn> Is it possible to fire off a oneshot script on reboot, complete with informative "loading" indicator?
[02:05] <k_sze[work]> There is something I don't understand about `apt-get -f install`. Suppose I `dpkg -i some.deb`, so dpkg unpacks it and says it has unsatisfied dependencies, so I run `apt-get -f install` to fix the broken dependencies. Is apt-get supposed to finish installing some.deb at the same time?
[02:06] <k_sze[work]> Or am I supposed to run `dpkg -i some.deb` manually after `apt-get -f install`?
[02:07] <frank> Where can I report potential security issues with the linux download server?
[02:08] <frank> Is anyone there?
[02:09] <Hoffman> how do I upgrade to yakkity from the command line?
[02:09] <hggdh> frank: which linux download server?
[02:10] <frank> http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/
[02:10] <hggdh> k_sze[work]: -f install should finish a pending install
[02:10] <k1l_> Hoffman: use "sudo do-release-upgrade"
[02:11] <Hoffman> k1l_: "no new release found"
[02:11] <frank> The SHA1SUM.gpg and SHA256.gpg did not match the signatures given to me by the signature varification page on the main Ubuntu site
[02:11] <k1l_> !upgradeofflts | Hoffman
[02:11] <ubottu> Hoffman: To upgrade from an LTS release of Ubuntu to the next (non-LTS) release, run sudoedit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and change the prompt= line to "prompt=normal". Then, do sudo do-release-upgrade to begin the upgrade.
[02:11] <k_sze[work]> hggdh: so what happens is that the first `dpkg -i some.deb` would mark some.deb as pending install, and `apt-get -f install` would fix the dependencies *and* finish installing some.deb?
[02:11] <Hoffman> ubottu: thanks, ill give it a shot
[02:11] <ubottu> Hoffman: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[02:11] <hggdh> frank: (1) you can open a bug on it; (2) you can go to #ubuntu-hardened and talk about it (and, eventually, send an encrypted mail to one of the security folks there
[02:11] <hggdh> k_sze[work]: yes -- if the dependencies are resolvable
[02:12] <Hoffman> k1l_: that did it
[02:12] <Hoffman> the hand-editing
[02:12] <Hoffman> thanks!
[02:12] <k_sze[work]> hggdh: I see. Thanks. :)
[02:12] <frank> Where is the #ubuntu-hardened page located?
[02:15] <hggdh> frank: IRC channel. /join #ubuntu-hardened. But, right now, it is probable that the security team is asleep (sbeattie, mdeslaur, and others my memory fails at the moment
[02:17] <k1l_> frank: are you sure its not just a download corruption?
[02:17] <hggdh> frank: the list of members of the security team is at https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security
[02:20] <jr3> should I install the bootloader on the same device as my  windows bootloader or a different device?

[02:29] <cybermomo> and I have no idea what's going on
[02:30] <Grandolf> Cybermomo, at the risk of sounding dumb, what is a pen testing class?
[02:30] <cybermomo> penetration testing
[02:30] <Grandolf> ic
[02:30] <cybermomo> "ethical hacking"
[02:30] <Grandolf> i didnt think it was litteraly pen testing :P
[02:31] <cybermomo> lol nope
[02:31] <cybermomo> but I like linux so far
[02:31] <cybermomo> the GUI, I mean
[02:31] <lordcirth> cybermomo, if you are taking a kali class, why not install kali?
[02:31] <Grandolf> its very nice
[02:31] <cybermomo> I want to learn the basics first
[02:31] <lordcirth> Ah
[02:31] <cybermomo> do you guys recommend resources?
[02:31] <gry> yes sure
[02:32] <gry> ubuntu's help center should be fine to start with
[02:32] <gry> you don't need to use 'online' documentation if you'd like to simply get started with the basics
[02:32] <cybermomo> ok

[02:32] <cybermomo> awesome. Thanks!
[02:32] <cybermomo> one more question
[02:33] <cybermomo> what is a best IDE for C++
[02:33] <gry> code::blocks
[02:33] <notadeveloper> geany
[02:33] <cybermomo> do I need to install the compiler for geany?
[02:33] <notadeveloper> yes
[02:34] <notadeveloper> apt-get install build-essential geany
[02:34] <notadeveloper> then
[02:34] <gry> code::blocks has the advantage of being able to debug and design gui apps
[02:34] <notadeveloper> cool
[02:35] <cybermomo> OK; I'll try it
[02:35] <cybermomo> thank you so much guys !
[02:35] <Grandolf> are there any entertaining ways to learn C++?
[02:35] <cybermomo> there is always youtube
[02:35] <crazyadm> people still use c++?
[02:36] <Grandolf> well, its for a game i play, called minetest
[02:36] <cybermomo> c++ is a high level language
[02:36] <Grandolf> and yes, ppl do :)
[02:36] <cybermomo> and as a cyber security student, I have to learn it
[02:36] <crazyadm> i see most of them use java, php, python
[02:36] <verticlebert> Yeah a ton of people use it. cybermomo:he's just being cranky
[02:36] <cybermomo> try cybrary.it
[02:36] <cybermomo> hahaha
[02:36] <verticlebert> c++ is very very helpful
[02:37] <cybermomo> there is a course on python for security professionals
[02:37] <cybermomo> u should try it, so fun
[02:37] <verticlebert> yeah but sometimes python has limitations like perfromance you need c++ for.
[02:38] <cybermomo> to be honest with you, my mind in a loop right now
[02:38] <Guest15630> guys, I have a problem with my pci wireless card. I am using ubuntu 16.04 but the problem was also present on ubuntu 15.10
[02:38] <crazyadm> go for assembler for performance
[02:39] <verticlebert> Guest15630: use 16.10. /s
[02:39] <Guest15630> basically after some random amount of time(could be anywhere from a couple of hours to several days) the computer will disconnect from wifi and I'll be unable to connect to it or any other network(they will still be listed) closing the session won't fix the problem, only rebooting
[02:39] <Grandolf> cybary looks intresting, but how skillful do you need to be to start it?
[02:40] <cybermomo> if you go to courses
[02:40] <Guest15630> and I don't know if this is related, but is the only other thing that could be helpful. when im on the login screen, networks will appear but i will be unable to connect to network as it will pop up a dialog saying insufficient privilege
[02:40] <cybermomo> there will courses based on skills
[02:41] <lordcirth> I'd just like to mention that most pentesting courses are useless
[02:41] <cybermomo> how come?
[02:41] <Guest15630> and likely unrelated but i haven't updated to 16.10 because I haven't gotten the option to, not even update-manager -d shows it
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest32988

[02:42] <myraft> hey guys , need help. After several updates 4.4.0-43 ( on Ubuntu 16.04), the system boots to a dithered / unreadable screen.
[02:42] <myraft> don't know how to proceed.
[02:43] <lordcirth> myraft, did you boot 4.4.0-42 again?  Does it work?
[02:43] <myraft> lordcirth, Yes, that is what I am doing now.
[02:43] <lordcirth> myraft, well, the lazy way is to keep doing that until 44 comes out :P
[02:43] <cybermomo> still pen testing will give you a lot of knowledge
[02:44] <Guest15630> uhm, doesn't 16.10 come with 4.8?
[02:44] <cybermomo> the idea of pen testing is cool
[02:44] <k1l_> it does, Guest15630
[02:44] <myraft> lordcirth, that was the plan - nevertheless thought of asking if anyone experienced it or knows a way out.
[02:44] <myraft> or should I move to 16.10 ?

[02:49] <Guest15630> actually, I'm a little worried now, webupd8's nemo ppa hasn't been updated to the new version. nemo shouldn't be uninstalled as long as it doesn't interfere with other package's updates, right?
[02:51] <OerHeks> any ppa, and you are on your own
[02:57] <V7> Can I just copy files from / to other folder to make backup ?
[03:01] <Bashing-om> V7: Depends on if the destination will also be overwritten in a re-install . Backup best kept off the machine in a safe place .
[03:01] <OerHeks> Depends on more things, like filesystem
[03:01] <V7> Bashing-om: So .. if I copy all stuff to USB pendrive with ext4 filysystem then would I recover if by copy paste all stuff ?
[03:03] <Bashing-om> V7: Well again depends . "stuff" being system files .. that you then may have dependency issues if copied back ?
[03:03] <k1l_> V7: that doesnt sound like a bakcup plan. why backup system stuff, that is installed fast again. if its userdata or configurations, then they dont ly on /
[03:04] <lordcirth> put your package list in your homedir, then backup /home
[03:05] <V7> Sistuation ...
[03:05] <V7> I have 32GB pendrive
[03:05] <V7> And I need to make on it Backup of system which is installed on 100GB partition
[03:06] <V7> I wanted to make that with dd, but ... I didn't know that system which weights jsut 15 gb is installed on 100GB partition ...
[03:07] <lordcirth> dd is a very inefficient backup
[03:07] <lordcirth> V7, you could use clonezilla, or like we said, just backup /home and maybe a package list
[03:07] <lordcirth> Most of the space outside /home is just packages you can redownload.
[03:07] <Bashing-om> V7: All that is really needed for a backup is to back up personal data ( /home ) and keep a change log of any changes you make to system files .
[03:07] <k1l_> worth looking at /opt and /etc
[03:08] <V7> hmm
[03:08] <V7> Yeah ... I understood ..
[03:08] <lordcirth> yeah, /etc maybe for some systems
[03:09] <V7> So ... if I need to make a whole system backup I need a device with 100GB partition too ?
[03:09] <k1l_> the idea is: you dont need to backup files, that are on every ubuntu install usb :)
[03:09] <lintop> whats the best program for transfering music to an old ipod nano?
[03:09] <V7> I understood you k1, but I won't have internet then
[03:09] <tksn> So how is ZFS For Linux coming along?
[03:10] <lordcirth> tksn, great, 16.04 has it as a normal package.
[03:10] <k1l_> tksn: works like the years before :) ubuntu just included it to make it work easier for data partitions or container usage
[03:10] <lordcirth> We run several production servers on it, and my PC and home server use it.
[03:11] <Daxtir> does anyone know how to get UFW to stop blocking the ESP protocol?
[03:11] <OerHeks> lintop, there is no single best, here are some examples https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone
[03:11] <tksn> I'm wondering how it holds up for workstation usage... read/write speeds, and all that
[03:11] <lordcirth> Daxtir, look up what port ESP uses, and unblock it
[03:11] <lordcirth> tksn, well, I don't have benchmarks, but generally ZFS is really fast
[03:12] <k1l_> tksn: depends heavily on the setup (raid,zraid etc). but the idea behind zfs is more data integrity.
[03:12] <auk> hi everyone, i just misused tasksel and managed to remove pretty much the whole system
[03:13] <lordcirth> auk, nice.  The fastest solution is to load the backups you totally have, right?
[03:13] <auk> lordcirth: no solution from inside the install? i still haven't rebooted
[03:13] <tksn> Would any of you change from using ext4 to zfs on your laptops, stationary, workstations, etc?
[03:13] <lordcirth> auk, I said fastest, not only
[03:14] <k1l_> auk depends on what you did. if its a desktop reinstall the desktop package?
[03:14] <lordcirth> tksn, ZFS on root is not easy yet
[03:14] <OerHeks> taksel does not purge configs and data, iirc
[03:14] <lordcirth> tksn, I run btrfs root, ZFS data.
[03:14] <auk> lordcirth: yes fastest would be a new clean install. Except all the time to reconfigure :(
[03:14] <k1l_> tksn: on workstations, servers? i even did that.
[03:14] <lordcirth> auk, thus the backups :)
[03:14] <tksn> Hows btrfs coming along? Last time I tangoed with it (sometime ago) it completely borped on me
[03:14] <chipping> auk: what *do* you still have? does apt work?
[03:15] <auk> lordcirth: i can easily boot a live cd and backup all data, i guess my question now is is it possible to extract a list of the package set?
[03:15] <Daxtir> lordcirth /var/log/syslog doesn't list a DPT when it blocks a connection attempt with protocol ESP
[03:16] <k1l_> tksn: zfs is a lot more mature than btrfs. should be fine for personal usage, but i would not put important data without working backup plan on btrfs
[03:16] <auk> chipping: not sure really, the tasksel operation bailed out with "cant exec /usr/lib/tasksel/packages/manual"
[03:16] <lordcirth> Daxtir, just looked up ESP, the ufw manpage has an example
[03:16] <chipping> auk: can you run something like `apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^` ?
[03:16] <auk> chipping: re-ran tasksel and selected standart ubuntu desktop, said unmet dependencies
[03:17] <chipping> aha
[03:17] <auk> tried "apt-get -f isntall"
[03:17] <lordcirth> k1l_, agreed, but then, you shouldn't have important data anywhere without backups
[03:17] <Daxtir> lordcirth, the stuff like "ufw allow to 10.0.0.1 proto esp"? I already did that, it doesn't work
[03:17] <auk> chipping: that bailed out as well on libnl-*something*
[03:17] <lordcirth> The main advantages to btrfs for me are 1) easily installed as rootfs and 2) changing layouts on the fly
[03:18] <chipping> auk: boot from livecd, mount your disk, copy your stuff off onto another disk, re-install :-/
[03:18] <auk> chipping: :D
[03:19] <tksn> k1l_: my thoughts exactly... I don't trust it at all.. i had high hopes for it...buuut... bork
[03:20] <auk> chipping, lordcirth: alright that's what i will do. Any idea of how this could happen with a tasksel operation? I belive the problem was I selected "manual package set"
[03:20] <chipping> I'm not familiar enough with tasksel to be sure
[03:20] <auk> chipping, lordcirth : but it did not confirm, just started uninstalling things like the kernel and apt and crazy stuff
[03:20] <lordcirth> auk, no idea, I have only added things with tasksel, never used it to remove.
[03:21] <chipping> I just stick to apt :-)
[03:21] <lordcirth> Looking it up, I don't see anything in the man page about removing stuff.
[03:21] <lordcirth> Perhaps you tried to install something that conflicted with lots of stuff?
[03:22] <janat08> how to tell chrome to use another default for magnet links
[03:22] <chipping> that even being possible terrifies me
[03:22] <OerHeks> tasksel had problems before removing services, but manually you can mess up easily
[03:22] <auk> chipping, lordcirth yeah i didn't think tasksel would remove stuff either :(
[03:22] <auk> OerHeks: "before removing services"? i don't understand
[03:23] <chipping> I'd want at least a scary warning and a couple of "are you REALLY sure" prompts before just scrubbing the kernel :-D
[03:23] <cash> Hi Everyone - How do I stop the screen lock from kicking in when firefox plays videos full screen?  This should happen automatically but it doesnt
[03:23] <auk> what i wanted tasksel for was to reconfigure a full standard unity install, trying to switch back from gnome
[03:23] <OerHeks> .. had problems before, removing services
[03:23] <Random832> auk: I think that's meant as "has had problems before" and "removing services" as separate clauses
[03:23] <kiki_lamb> Are upstart service names derived solely from the name of the .conf?
[03:23] <auk> chipping: yeah :/
[03:23] <auk> OerHeks, Random832 : ah ok :)
[03:24] <kiki_lamb> I'm trying to restart a service whose definition is at /etc/init/api.someapplication.ca.conf, but can't figure out the syntax
[03:24] <paddymahoney> kiki_lamb: sudo systemctl restart api.someapplication.ca.service ?

[03:27] <auk> cash: not sure what desktop env you're in but you could try "caffeine". should be in the repos
[03:27] <auk> cash: there's also a gnome shell extension with the same name
[03:28] <auk> cash: you activate it manually and also i think it has a feature to detect full screen and activate then
[03:29] <OerHeks> so does firefox.
[03:29] <auk> kiki_lamb: systemctl should also list services for you (enabled or not), look in man systemctl
[03:30] <auk> OerHeks: well he was saying it wasn't working? :/
[03:30] <kiki_lamb> paddymahoney: huh, weird - i'd tried literally that exact command ('auk's') and was getting an 'unrecognized', disconnected and reconnected my shell and now it works. must have confused something inside the session or something.

[03:30] <BlackDalek> my Fn key on laptop stopped working yesterday. I get no response from it when trying to use screen brightness/volume control function keys
[03:31] <eaglebot> what?
[03:31] <lordcirth> BlackDalek, install xev, run it, make sure it's focused, and see if pressing those keys does anything on the command line.
[03:31] <lordcirth> If it doesn't, it's probably a hardware problem
[03:32] <BlackDalek> thanks
[03:33] <janat08> how to change default client for magnet links
[03:33] <BlackDalek> lordcirth, pressing the fn key shows no response in xev. Does this mean the key itself is dead?
=== cigumo_ is now known as cigumo
[03:34] <lordcirth> BlackDalek, press fn + the other key
[03:34] <lordcirth> Sometimes the Fn key never gets sent to the OS, it is combined in the keyboard controller
[03:35] <BlackDalek> lordcirth, suddenly the fn key is working now.. weird....
[03:36] <BlackDalek> the volume and brightness fn keys are all working again. Not sure why it died for past 24 hours. It suddenly started to function again after running xev.
[03:37] <lordcirth> odd
[03:37] <BlackDalek> I don't understand how it is working again now :/
[03:37] <lordcirth> possibly intermittent hardware failure. maybe software.  If it happens again, test again
[03:37] <lordcirth> See if Fn + key shows a different event than just the key
[03:38] <BlackDalek> yeah... maybe some dirt under the key membrane
[03:38] <chipping> BlackDalek: now might be a good time to test the integrity of your backups :-P
[03:40] <BlackDalek> lordcirth, yes, pressing fn+f2 or f2 by itself shows different input in xev

[03:47] <Ben64> not fixed yet?
[03:47] <cash> Guys thanks for the tips - Using unity on 16.04
[03:47] <cash> I tried sudo apt install caffeine today but the program failed :/
[03:47] <cash> It installed, but would not open
[03:48] <Ben64> what error
[03:49] <cash> Didnt see an error - it just didnt do anything.  Ill try installing from software cntr
[03:50] <cash> hmm so the cntr has "caffeine indicator"
[03:50] <cash> i installed it but it doesnt appear to be configurable
[03:54] <antiPoP> hi, while updating initramfs-tools , I guet several of these errors: "sh: 0: getcwd() failed: No such file or directory". Why that?
[03:54] <wafflejock> cash, http://askubuntu.com/questions/469225/trusty-caffeine-doesnt-appear-in-panel-after-update <-- appears it doesn't have any configuration just keeps the machine from going idle
[03:54] <wafflejock> cash, typically when apps do have config you'll find them in /etc/appnamehere/somefile.conf
[03:54] <cash> Ok
[03:55] <cash> Got it
[03:55] <cash> Thanks for the tip - wasnt sure it was working
[03:55] <cash> You'd think ubuntu would do this automatically - or at least have hot-corners like a mac where the SL can be deactivated
[03:55] <cash> but this is my only complaint with ubuntu - use it on all my machines, one of which is a mac
[03:56] <cash> and its the ONLY os on the mac, so take that osx
[03:56] <linocisco> Ben64, I can't see what error. slow shutdown. after shuttting down, under ubuntu log and text, blinking dots so long like 6 mins or more
[03:56] <wafflejock> heh yeah cash there are some things in compiz or comiz config settings manager more specifically about tying corners to actions but since using Gnome 3 haven't really messed with compiz lately
[03:57] <cash> Yeah
[03:58] <cash> gnome 3 is pretty good too i also like it -- it makes hitting the super key addictive
[03:58] <linocisco> Ben64, /etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf ?
[04:03] <Ben64> linocisco: but it shutdown fast that one time after i told you to disable wifi?
[04:03] <linocisco> Ben64, i am not sure
[04:04] <linocisco> Ben64, better to turn off wifi everytime before shutdown? why is that?

[04:46] <moparisthebest> does anyone know when or if linux-image-generic-lts-yakkety will be available for trusty?
[04:47] <lotuspsychje> !mainline | moparisthebest
[04:47] <ubottu> moparisthebest: The kernel team supply continuous mainline kernel builds which can be useful for tracking down issues or testing recent changes in the Linux kernel. More information is available at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/MainlineBuilds
[04:48] <moparisthebest> oh I'm aware of those
[04:49] <lotuspsychje> moparisthebest: what are you trying to do exactly?
[04:50] <moparisthebest> I was asking when or if linux-image-generic-lts-yakkety was going to be available
[04:50] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: not sure or know how to check?
[04:50] <moparisthebest> I don't know how they decide if for one
[04:51] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: lsb_release -a
[04:53] <lotuspsychje> moparisthebest: yes, but what is your purpose to get this kernel?
[04:53] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: http://pastebin.com/XuAAJEE0
[04:53] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: I don't think it says that detail ^
[04:53] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: its ok, your on .1
[04:54] <moparisthebest> lotuspsychje, I hit btrfs kernel bugs with previous versions, supposedly fixed in 4.8
[04:54] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: Oh I see it in the output now ( in Description field )
[04:54] <lotuspsychje> moparisthebest: why not install 4.8 kernel mainline then?
[04:55] <moparisthebest> lotuspsychje, I haven't rebooted yet, but the mainline 4.7.2 kernel won't boot at all, I figured maybe 4.8 might be like that too
[04:55] <moparisthebest> the linux-image-generic-lts-yakkety would be 'official' and I could be confident it would boot
[04:56] <lotuspsychje> !dvd | werdfriek did you try this?
[04:56] <ubottu> werdfriek did you try this?: Ubuntu's default installation and repositories do not include packages needed to play commercial DVDs for legal reasons. For information on adding them, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs | For information on the legalities involved, see the "DVD" section of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[04:56] <moparisthebest> I'm on the mainline 4.5.6 now, and it has the same bugs
[04:56] <lotuspsychje> moparisthebest: did you bug your issue yet?
[04:56] <moparisthebest> lotuspsychje, yep, on the btrfs mailing list
[04:57] <lotuspsychje> moparisthebest: have you tried a liveusb/dvd of 16.10 yet, to see if you can bypass your bug?
[04:57] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: I completely understand. "I found: http://askubuntu.com/questions/505684/vlc-wont-play-dvd-movies  <---  and from it got sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras && sudo apt-get install libdvd-pkg  <---  and I restarted the computer, but still no success."
[04:57] <moparisthebest> lotuspsychje, can't, it happened while balancing a 30TB array which takes weeks, and I can't have the server down for that long

[04:59] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: did it work on other ubuntu version?
[04:59] <moparisthebest> if it can read regular data dvds or cds I'd expect it works werdfriek ?
[05:00] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: I actually ran 14.04 up until about 2 weeks ago. Yeah, vlc works fine on 14.04
[05:00] <cfhowlett> werdfriek,that may be but parts do break - all the time and unpredictably. see mice, keyboard issues.  suggest you verify that the dvd functions
[05:00] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: you mean the dvd + vlc?
[05:01] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: I'm not sure I understand the question
[05:01] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: you say vlc worked fine in trusty, playing a dvd disc right
[05:04] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: honestly, it's been quite a while since I played a movie disc (otc and not a copy too) but I do recall that vlc has always seemed to handle just about any move I threw at it. Now, having just upgraded to 16.04, I can't get any move to play (yet I've followed the standard procedure). idk
[05:04] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: ok, try this: from terminal: tail -f /var/log/syslog and launch vlc from a new terminal to see errors on both sides
[05:05] <lotuspsychje> werdfriek: then try to play your dvd disc
[05:16] <werdfriek> lotuspsychje: Ok, so I verified that the disc drive is working by instering and browsing around in a disc I have that contains some backed up (linux) dirs on it. No problem there. Then I tried tail -f /var/log/syslog  and  launching vlc in another terminal (tab) - once with that data disc in the drive and once with nothing in the drive - the results are not identical.

[06:38] <FireStriker> hello
[06:40] <FireStriker> I am new to Ubuntu how do you make a boot usb
[06:40] <cfhowlett> !usb | FireStriker
[06:40] <ubottu> FireStriker: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[06:40] <proxx_> if your r gonna use ubuntu also make sure you know how to use a search engine
[06:41] <FireStriker> ok so like to look up stuff or is it diffent in linux
[06:42] <cfhowlett> FireStriker, it is no different in linux.
[06:42] <FireStriker> ok
[06:42] <dust> ubuntu-drivers-common:i386:
[06:42] <dust>  Depends: python3-apt but it is not going to be installed
[06:42] <dust>  Depends: python3-xkit  but it is not installable
[06:42] <dust>   Conflicts: ubuntu-drivers-common  but 1:0.4.22 is to be installed
[06:42] <dust> because of this steam dosnt work
[06:43] <FireStriker> i am instaling it as a duel boot, want to have a look on the other side
[06:43] <cfhowlett> !dualboot | FireStriker

[06:44] <FireStriker> thanks for the quick replies
[06:44] <cfhowlett> happy2help! FireStriker
[06:44] <ducasse> FireStriker: you can also test it on a usb, to decide if you want to install
[06:47] <janat08> how to change default client for magnet links
[06:47] <FireStriker> yea i know the live 'cd'
[06:48] <FireStriker> i have a old laptop that i am looking at installing it on
[06:48] <cfhowlett> FireStriker, "old"?  how old?\
[06:49] <Schzd> Hello, I have a little problem new to the whole linux thing. I have 2 hard disk of the same model not on Raid but detect as so. How would one proceed to access them?
[06:49] <FireStriker> vista max of 2gb (ddr2) 1.86GHz Pentium
[06:50] <cfhowlett> FireStriker, ah. strongly suggest you go with lubuntu instead of ubuntu.  lubuntu is optimized for legacy hadrdware.
=== sins-_y is now known as sins-
[06:51] <xsmltx> Hi, tell me please is there any way to enable right click to use it on the touch screen device with Lubunut-core minimal installation and Fluxbox the only installed environment? I've been trying with easystroke, but no result yet. I would really appreciate any clue . Thank you.
[06:51] <destini> anyone here???
[06:51] <FireStriker> ok what can lubuntu do?
[06:51] <cfhowlett> only about 1000 people today destini.  better to just ask your ubuntu questions
[06:51] <cfhowlett> !lubuntu | FireStriker
[06:51] <ubottu> FireStriker: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[06:52] <proxx_> Schzd , use mdadm , I could write a whole lotta stuff but just look at this : http://askubuntu.com/questions/247981/software-raid-mdadm-re-find-my-array
=== for{} is now known as Tranquilizer
[06:52] <destini> When is the next update for Ubuntu coming?
[06:53] <cfhowlett> destini, every 6 months within release.
[06:54] <wafflejock> destini, 16.10 just came out the version is year.month and like cfhowlett said every 6 months so next version is 17.04
[06:54] <destini> what was the last update? I'm currently using 16.04
[06:54] <cfhowlett> destini, you should be on 16.04.1    sudo apt full-upgrade        will get you there
[06:54] <FireStriker> can Lubuntu do everything that Ubuntu does
[06:55] <cfhowlett> FireStriker, lubuntu IS ubuntu.
[06:55] <FireStriker> ok
[06:55] <cfhowlett> different gui
[06:55] <destini> Much more than that, but different GUI
[06:56] <FireStriker> is the boot usb creation the same
[06:56] <FireStriker> have just downloaded rufus
[06:56] <wafflejock> FireStriker, yeah in either case just dealing with an image
[06:56] <FireStriker> ok
[06:56] <destini> Boot USB creation has always been the same so far
[06:57] <Schzd> proxx_, not quite my problem i don't want to do a raid i have disk that are falsely said to be in raid, but they are not and ubuntu doesn't give me access to them. I cant mount them. they work fine on windows though.
[06:57] <destini> Rufus can create Bootable USB
[06:57] <destini> Just give path to the selected ISO
[06:57] <destini> there you go...
[06:57] <proxx_> Schzd ,  what do you want to do ?
[06:58] <FireStriker> is the Ubuntu page for how to do a windows duel boot the same with Lubuntu
[06:58] <Schzd> proxx_, mount them to have access to the files.
[06:58] <cfhowlett> FireStriker, yes
[06:58] <FireStriker> ok
[06:59] <proxx_> Schzd what happens if you just do mount /dev/sdX /mnt ?
[07:00] <Schzd> proxx_, mount: unknown filesystem type 'promise_fasttrack_raid_member'
[07:01] <proxx_> Schzd and what kinda raid is on it, some windows thing or ?
[07:02] <ducasse> Schzd: can you pastebin output of lsblk?
[07:02] <proxx_> Ah its a fake aka bios raid
[07:02] <proxx_> ugh
[07:02] <Schzd> ok
[07:03] <ducasse> Schzd: are you sure bios is set to ahci, not raid?
[07:03] <proxx_> I would suggest you backup that data and wipe it
[07:03] <proxx_> then repart and use it again like its supposed to , this fakeraid crap is not what you want
[07:04] <Schzd> not sure about those.
[07:05] <Schzd> Is there a better way?
[07:05] <Schzd> well one that doesn't take 3 hours of copying files
[07:05] <FireStriker> Steam works on Ubuntu and Lubuntu right?
[07:05] <proxx_> Im sure its possible to mount it , just saying that this is not a very permanent solution
[07:05] <cfhowlett> FireStriker, again.  yes.  Lubuntu IS ubuntu!  same parent company, same software sources
[07:05] <proxx_> asking for trouble really
[07:06] <Schzd> Ok i
[07:06] <proxx_> Can you post output of lspci to paste something
[07:06] <Schzd> http://pastebin.com/Nrqenf9A
[07:06] <Schzd> wrong one
[07:07] <FireStriker> thanks
[07:07] <Schzd> http://pastebin.com/xv8DMPS9
[07:09] <proxx_> Schzd that should be your raid controller http://blog.stuffedcow.net/2012/08/jmicron-jmb36x-add-on-card-ahci-mode/
[07:09] <proxx_> "raid" controller
[07:11] <Schzd> proxx_, thx for the help! btw! now i know my problem better.
[07:11] <azizLIGHT> i have a ppa for wine-staging and whenever i get updates, ubuntu has this strange icon in panel that looks like red circle with white horizontal line in middle of it. here is what it looks like: http://i.imgur.com/RjfnuPP.png
[07:11] <azizLIGHT> why is it there and how to stop it
[07:12] <cfhowlett> azizLIGHT, that is the error icon.
[07:12] <proxx_> Schzd also came cross this http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/ubuntu-10-04-jmicron-jmb363-sata-controller-kernel-freeze-872264/
[07:13] <proxx_> Schzd im trying to understand if one needs a special driver for this thing
[07:13] <farhad> can i use backintime on vps?     http://backintime.le-web.org/
[07:14] <Schzd> proxx_, I might just as well do the Format thing tommorrow and deactivate that.
[07:14] <proxx_> Schzd I would recommend it , if you want a raid and run linux I suggest you just use mdadm for a raid setup
[07:14] <ducasse> farhad: sure, but you would probably be better off with rsync and maybe rsnapshot.
[07:16] <Schzd> proxx_, i don't want a raid system is on a SSD. it's my code project that i keep on one of those 2 harddrives. just new to linux and all.
[07:16] <Schzd> proxx_, i suck at punctuation...
[07:19] <farhad> ducasse: Iv installed backintime and configured it. i use it. theres no error! but its not working????forexample i installed htop after backup. but when i restore, htop still exist. can i show you my working on http://paste.ubuntu.com
[07:19] <Schzd> proxx_, Installed linux cause windows doesn't like running things properly. I'll learn how to use it, thanks for the help.
[07:20] <proxx_> Schzd welcome dude
[07:21] <proxx_> Schzd you might wanna check if you can put that drive in regular mode from the BIOS , the raid chipset is prob onboard
[07:21] <proxx_> Schzd and ofc be sure to keep a backup , might mess things up
[07:23] <lonix> Anyone have a good way of connecting to a MSSql Server CLI mode ?
[07:24] <proxx_> lonix yeah use ssh
[07:25] <proxx_> ssh into the box , connect sql client to localhost
[07:25] <lonix> proxx_: so step 1, install cygwin ?
[07:26] <lonix> :P

[07:33] <ambient> Hey, I am trying to install amdgpu pro drivers, can anyone help?
[07:34] <ambient> I read this: http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMDGPU-PRO-Install.aspx
[07:34] <DevAntoine> hi
[07:34] <ambient> But it is not clear on how, exactly to install the driver, it just says 'instal it'
[07:35] <DevAntoine> I've got such a weird issue. When I use ethernet I'm not able to reach the internet, only the local network. But if I unplug the ethernet and only use wifi it works fine
[07:36] <eaglebot> also how can mounting the install iso be emulated for apt-get?
[07:36] <eaglebot> certain things want the iso
=== Max_ is now known as Guest50900
[07:36] <eaglebot> I have the iso stored on the machine but loop mounting doesnt mount the device /dev/cdrom
[07:37] <ambient> I get "ln: failed to create symbolic link '/usr/bin/amdgpu-pro-uninstall': File exists"
[07:37] <ouroumov_> DevAntoine, you can ping the router and other hosts on the network but your packets won't leave your LAN?
[07:37] <DevAntoine> ouroumov_: yes
[07:38] <ouroumov_> DevAntoine, then the router is probably misconfigured and dropping your packets
[07:38] <DevAntoine> ouroumov_: why would it work using the wifi? I'm the only one in my company having this kind of issue. Everything worked fine yesterday, I rebooted and now I can't use ethernet
[07:39] <wafflejock> DevAntoine, have you tested with ping or seen if it's just dns or actually not able to send out?
[07:39] <DevAntoine> nah, it's not a dns issue, I can't ping 8.8.8.8
[07:39] <DevAntoine> wifi and ethernet are auto configured via network manager
[07:40] <wafflejock> mmm, yeah short of IP conflict or something not sure
[07:40] <wafflejock> ya
[07:40] <DevAntoine> there's a DHCP
[07:40] <wafflejock> yah being able to talk around the internal network seems to mean that's all working fine hard to blame it on anything but the router then though
[07:40] <alkisg> DevAntoine: what's the name of your ethernet device (e.g. eth0)? `ip a` shows it.
[07:42] <DevAntoine> alkisg: http://pastebin.com/4S34J1JA
[07:42] <DevAntoine> ip a + ifconfig
[07:42] <alkisg> DevAntoine: ok, now try this: sudo /usr/lib/klibc/bin/ipconfig -n enp0s25. That's a "fake" DHCP request, it just checks if your computer can get an IP from a DHCP server.
[07:42] <DevAntoine> (fwiw I've unplugged the ethernet, if not I won't be able to access IRC)
[07:42] <alkisg> Does DHCP work fine on that NIC?
[07:42] <DevAntoine> alkisg: do I need to plug the ethernet before doing that?
[07:43] <alkisg> DevAntoine: when you plug the ethernet, you lose your wifi connection?
[07:43] <alkisg> Yes, you need to plug it for dhcp to work
[07:43] <DevAntoine> alkisg: well, network manager detects that the ethernet is plugged so it's is set as the first connection so I lose wifi
[07:43] <wafflejock> alkisg, yeah I think NetworkManager auto switches to ethernet if it's present

[08:21] <ouroumov> DevAntoine, you don't happen to have a ubuntu USB boot stick handy? If you can ping 8.8.8.8 on ethernet from the live session we'd know for sure this is because of the update
[08:21] <DevAntoine> ouroumov: which update?
[08:21] <ouroumov> You said there was an update yesterday, and this morning on boot it was not working anymore, no?
[08:22] <alkisg> DevAntoine, sorry, I missed the paste of `ip r`, where was that?

[08:32] <DevAntoine> alkisg: ip is assigned based on mac address? I can't just try another ethernet wire?
[08:33] <alkisg> DevAntoine, no, it's somewhat random which IP you'll get, but there's a "lease", meaning after e.g. 30 days you may get a different one
[08:33] <DevAntoine> because my ip is 10.2.17.251 but it was a static ip that a coworker fixed for me yesterday. Now I've deleted the network manager profile to use the dhcp again but I still got the same ip. Coworkers says it's because of the dhcp ttl or something like that but I found this suspicious
[08:33] <DevAntoine> erf
[08:34] <alkisg> DevAntoine, you can try pinging an IP to see if it's unused, and then use that static one for a while, as a test. E.g. ping 10.2.17.2
[08:35] <DevAntoine> alkisg: how can I set the static ip then?
[08:35] <DevAntoine> $ cat /run/network/ifstate
[08:35] <DevAntoine> lo=lo
[08:35] <DevAntoine> suspicious no?
[08:35] <DevAntoine> no ethernet in it
[08:36] <alkisg> DevAntoine, from network manager
[08:36] <alkisg> Don't touch configuration files
[08:36] <wafflejock> DevAntoine, https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmcli.html the network manager handles interfaces that aren't in /etc/network/interfaces and the like
[08:37] <wafflejock> DevAntoine, this page covers it too https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager not sure exactly what to do though in terms of resetting DHCP from your end usually the router keeps the lease as described above
[08:37] <wafflejock> having a static IP shouldn't have effected DHCP on the router though

[09:02] <glontu> hi.
[09:02] <FireStriker> hi
[09:02] <Oliver777> hi
[09:02] <glontu> for 4 days now i keep trying to install ubuntu but the installer hangs at the end on "Copying installation logs"
[09:03] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: back
[09:03] <proxx_> thats a long install
[09:03] <UrsaTempest> Welcome!
[09:03] <FireStriker> yea
[09:03] <EriC^^> nevermind that's just a filemanager messing up stuff
[09:03] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: thanks, what does lsblk show now?
[09:03] <UrsaTempest> Right
[09:03] <glontu> i don't even know what that means or why does it need to do that ... but after waiting a long while i restart and it dosn't boot
[09:03] <UrsaTempest> Ah, I saw sdb1 now EriC^^
[09:04] <FireStriker> i hope my install doesnt take that long
[09:04] <glontu> does anyone here have any ideea how to get ubuntu installed on my computer ( it has one of those fancy new uefi boot things )
[09:04] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: ok, cool
[09:04] <Oliver777> did u use VMware Fusion?
[09:04] <cfhowlett> !eufi | glontu
[09:04] <FireStriker> 64 bit helps i think
[09:04] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: type sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1
[09:05] <EriC^^> URa
[09:05] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: 1 sec
[09:05] <EriC^^> make it, sudo mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdb1
[09:05] <UrsaTempest> FOrmatting began
[09:05] <UrsaTempest> ...errr
[09:05] <Oliver777> @glontu
[09:05] <UrsaTempest> ..do I have to abort?
[09:05] <EriC^^> so it makes it quicker
[09:05] <UrsaTempest> I'm fine waiting a bit, I guess
[09:05] <UrsaTempest> Thanks!
[09:05] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: no problem press ctrl+c and run it differently
[09:06] <UrsaTempest> It just give strange symbol
[09:06] <EriC^^> ^C ?
[09:06] <UrsaTempest> LIke ^C
[09:06] <proxx_> lol
[09:06] <UrsaTempest> Yesh
[09:06] <EriC^^> yeah
[09:06] <UrsaTempest> Press enter?
[09:06] <EriC^^> give it a few secs
[09:06] <UrsaTempest> Alright
[09:07] <kegan_> It's gonna STOP it
[09:07] <UrsaTempest> Right, done
[09:07] <kegan_> that's C says COOL it
[09:07] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: ok, cool
[09:07] <UrsaTempest> Yep, done
[09:07] <UrsaTempest> Formatting done.
[09:07] <UrsaTempest> That is quick.
[09:07] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: run it again with -f this time
[09:07] <UrsaTempest> Already did.
[09:08] <EriC^^> awesome
[09:08] <EriC^^> ok, now to mount the usb
[09:08] <alteregoa> i can't reinstall ldap it has a bug maybe
[09:08] <UrsaTempest> Right.
[09:08] <EriC^^> does it show up in the file manager now?
[09:08] <FireStriker> new to Ubuntu/Lubuntu in the process of making an boot usb and geting the host laptop ready
[09:08] <EriC^^> ok :)
[09:09] <UrsaTempest> I still have two USB somehow
[09:09] <FireStriker> got any tips for a newbie
[09:09] <kegan_> why might my system time be screwed up unless i manually set it to update from time servers?
[09:09] <UrsaTempest> Should I dismount and remount it?
[09:09] <kegan_> across two GNU partitions
[09:09] <kegan_> and windows 10
[09:09] <kegan_> consistently
[09:09] <EriC^^> nah
[09:09] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: it'll fix itself later
[09:09] <UrsaTempest> Okay. So.. I just click the drive, and it'll mount itself?
[09:09] <kegan_> FireStriker, print out the cheat sheet you're given when you boot up
[09:10] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: yeah that should do it
[09:10] <eli1____> I think yes?
[09:10] <UrsaTempest> Let's see...
[09:10] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: if it doesn't you can always do sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /place/to/mount/it
[09:10] <kegan_> FireStriker, get comfortable with using the terminal, update immediately, and, i don't know if this is something ubuntu corrects for or does on its own, so i'd wait for confirmation
[09:10] <eaglebot> Is there any way to install apk files in ubuntu without emulating the hardware?
[09:10] <kegan_> but create a user account separate from root and ensure that's your DTD login
[09:11] <eli1____> eaglebot: i don't think so
[09:11] <kegan_> if you aren't familiar, learn what man pages are, and have at it
[09:11] <UrsaTempest> I got 'drive busy' error, EriC^^
=== eli1____ is now known as elisaado
[09:11] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: hmm, try lsblk again
[09:11] <UrsaTempest> Err, 'device or resource' busy
[09:11] <glontu> so does anyone have any advice on installing ubuntu ? i tried from the live cd, and from a live usb. nothing works
[09:11] <EriC^^> take a look at the right column that says mountpoint at the top
[09:11] <UrsaTempest> sdb      8:16   1   7.2G  0 disk /media/bearstorm/Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS amd64
[09:11] <UrsaTempest> ‚îî‚îÄsdb1   8:17   1   7.2G  0 part
[09:11] <elisaado> maybe UrsaTempest you are in the directory
[09:12] <glontu> installer just hangs at "copying installation logs"
[09:12] <EriC^^> oh
[09:12] <UrsaTempest> Eh? So what should I do?
[09:12] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: run sudo umount /dev/sdb
[09:12] <FireStriker> ok will print that
[09:12] <elisaado> glontu: hmmm, maybe you should redownload the ISO
[09:12] <UrsaTempest> Done.
[09:12] <elisaado> it could be corrupted(?)
[09:12] <farhad> is there any body work by backintime or rsnapshot
[09:13] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: ok try mounting it from the file manager
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> I still have USB icon somehow
[09:13] <cfhowlett> glontu, md5sum verify the .iso you downloaded and do the same for the USB you ceated.
[09:13] <glontu> elisaado, i downloaded multiple iss of multiple versions. i tried 16 and 15
[09:13] <cfhowlett> !md5sum
[09:13] <ubottu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> Done.
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> Yep!
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> Seems it'll work
[09:13] <EriC^^> cool
[09:13] <elisaado> glontu: is it the good version?
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> Let me check it more
[09:13] <EriC^^> ok
[09:13] <glontu> elisaado, it's the LTS version
[09:13] <elisaado> glontu: 32, 64 bit, enough ram, enough space
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> Yep, seems it is working.
[09:13] <UrsaTempest> Thanks, EriC^^!
[09:14] <UrsaTempest> ...uh, I got 'Destination is Read-Only'
[09:14] <FireStriker> i know a big tip DONT MAKE A TYPO IN THE TERMINAL i know some one who almost wiped the whole server of all of the soffware that aquated to something like 5000 bucks or something
[09:14] <glontu> elisaado, i am using the 64 bit, 2tb, 32gb ram ... the live version works
[09:14] <elisaado> hmmmm
[09:14] <farhad> i cant use backintime or rsnapshot properly. is there any help?
[09:14] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: no problem, hmm
[09:14] <FireStriker> i was also told that Lubuntu is beter fit for my computer so i am going to instal that insted of Ubuntu
[09:15] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: type "mount | grep sdb"
[09:15] <UrsaTempest> That's strange. The permission tab of properties says I can create and delete file..
[09:15] <elisaado> when it hangs, what does happen when you just shut it down?
[09:15] <elisaado> and restart it
[09:15] <UrsaTempest> Uh, I should close file manager first right?
=== Tobirium1 is now known as Tobirium
[09:15] <EriC^^> nah it's ok
[09:15] <glontu> elisaado, i reboot and all i get is an underscore on a black screen. that's all
[09:16] <UrsaTempest>  /dev/sdb1 on /media/bearstorm/Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS amd64 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096,uhelper=udisks2)
[09:16] <UrsaTempest> That's what I got
[09:17] <kegan_> weird
[09:17] <EriC^^> ok go inside the usb's dir, then right click, open in a terminal
[09:17] <elisaado> glontu: i suggest you just wait, and when the installer hangs go to a tty (ctrl + alt + f1)
[09:18] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: then type "touch something"
[09:18] <glontu> ok. i'll do another install and try that. thanks elisado
[09:18] <UrsaTempest> Done. No visible output.
[09:18] <elisaado> np, I hope it'll work ;)
[09:18] <ruind> I configured a static IP on a new 16.04 install but after reboot /etc/resolv.conf is empty

[09:19] <elisaado> ruind: i think ubuntu changes it back
[09:19] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: i think the file manager just needs restarting or something
[09:19] <elisaado> maybe try changing it via the GUI
[09:19] <UrsaTempest> There is something, EriC^^
[09:19] <ruind> elisaado, changes what back?
[09:19] <elisaado> the conf
[09:19] <EriC^^> if it shows up
[09:19] <ruind> elisaado, ah i see
[09:19] <UrsaTempest> Yeah, there's a file named something
[09:19] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: try "pwd" does it say /media/bearstorm/ubuntu 16.04 ...?
[09:20] <UrsaTempest> Yep
[09:20] <UrsaTempest>  /media/bearstorm/Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS amd64
[09:20] <elisaado> ruind, i suggest trying to change it via the GUI tool (its a little bit noob, i know :p)
[09:20] <FireStriker> whats the settings for making a boot usb/
[09:20] <EriC^^> ok, try "nautilus -q"
[09:20] <EriC^^> it should quit the file manager
[09:20] <ruind> elisaado, sure ill give it a shot... should no need the GUI though...
[09:21] <UrsaTempest> Umm... this is unexpected result.. https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/5ohmlHxY/
[09:21] <elisaado> ruind, yeah i know
[09:21] <ruind> Well... actually i disabled network manager
[09:21] <ruind> for this interface
[09:21] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: hmm, no big deal i guess
[09:21] <elisaado> lol
[09:22] <UrsaTempest> Oh, good to know.
[09:22] <wafflejock> FireStriker, you already in ubuntu at this point and have an iso you want to put on a drive?
[09:22] <elisaado> then its weird that it changes back
[09:22] <EriC^^> UrsaTempest: try opening the file manager again, any luck?
[09:22] <elisaado> maybe change it and reload the networking service
[09:22] <UrsaTempest> I can make folder!
[09:22] <FireStriker> nope windows laptop target computer is windows vista atm
[09:22] <UrsaTempest> Let's try copying file

[09:35] <kegan_> I can also boot to the windows 10 CD
[09:35] <elisaado> and reinstall?
=== DevAntoine` is now known as DevAntoine
[09:36] <cfhowlett> kegan_, repair windows problems with windows tools.
[09:36] <kegan_> I mean, that's what I'm avoiding -.-
[09:36] <elisaado> ooohw :O :p
[09:36] <kegan_> I did that once
[09:36] <kegan_> it didn't fix the problem
[09:36] <kegan_> well, initially, it did
[09:36] <kegan_> stateful firewall, windows, and windows defender
[09:36] <kegan_> updates
[09:36] <kegan_> I don't visit stupid shit and I don't download a ton of programs
[09:37] <cfhowlett> rather questionable to expect linux to fully repair windows issues.
[09:37] <elisaado> did you download po*n?
[09:37] <elisaado> xD
[09:37] <kegan_> sigh
[09:37] <elisaado> seriously
[09:37] <kegan_> lol, yes, I agree, and not what I expect here
[09:37] <elisaado> a friend of mine downloaded some, and got a virus from it i guess
[09:38] <elisaado> hahaha lol
[09:38] <kegan_> I was hoping for some indication as to why I can't properly prepare a rescue CD via ubuntu
[09:38] <cfhowlett> ... "friend" ...
[09:38] <wafflejock> haha
[09:38] <elisaado> ooooh
[09:38] <elisaado> ehhh
[09:38] <elisaado> yes
[09:38] <elisaado> well
[09:38] <kegan_> USB
[09:38] <elisaado> rescue you say
[09:38] <elisaado> what sort of rescue cd/usb
[09:39] <elisaado> i mean, avg or microsoft official or
[09:39] <kegan_> bitdefender & kaspersky; both of which were recommended for this purpose specifically
[09:39] <kegan_> apparently they can repair system files
[09:39] <cfhowlett> ask in #windows.  completely offtopic here
[09:39] <kegan_> I did ask
[09:39] <elisaado> and they said?
[09:39] <Ben64> continue asking there
[09:39] <Ben64> windows issues aren't on topic here
[09:40] <kegan_> hear me out before you decide this is a window issue
[09:40] <elisaado> but he/she wants to prepare a cd in ubuntu
[09:40] <kegan_> I'm asking not for help repairing my windows partition
[09:40] <kegan_> I'm asking for help creating a BOOTABLE usb drive, from an iso, in ubuntu
[09:40] <elisaado> there are tools for that
[09:40] <kegan_> after having tried many different avenues
[09:40] <elisaado> lemme check
[09:40] <kegan_> unetbootin
[09:40] <kegan_> lots
[09:40] <Ben64> depends on the iso, ask who you got the iso from
[09:40] <elisaado> unetbootin ddidn't work?
[09:40] <kegan_> I compared their signatures
[09:41] <kegan_> from what the site purports and the file itself
[09:41] <elisaado> and it differs?
[09:41] <kegan_> no, I both downloaded the ISO and provided a source file
[09:41] <kegan_> no
[09:41] <kegan_> otherwise I'd not have used it...
[09:41] <elisaado> hmmm
[09:41] <kegan_> they were identical
[09:41] <Ben64> yep, not on topic
[09:41] <elisaado> and unetbootin didn't work?
[09:42] <elisaado> Ben64, where is it on-topic then?
[09:42] <kegan_> are you kidding me? this is about formatting and creating a UEFI device IN UBUNTU
[09:42] <elisaado> i agree with kegan_
[09:42] <elisaado> UBUNTU
[09:42] <Ben64> right, this channel does not cover everything you could ever do while using ubuntu
[09:42] <kegan_> if you give me an option, other than ##windows
[09:42] <elisaado> Then which channel does?
[09:42] <kegan_> I would happily give it a chance
[09:43] <elisaado> yeyah
[09:43] <Ben64> your problem is with windows, ask them the best way to fix the problem
[09:43] <kegan_> friend
[09:43] <Ben64> buddy
[09:43] <elisaado> HAHHAA
[09:43] <kegan_> they told me to create a bootable USB
[09:43] <kegan_> from these two images
[09:43] <kegan_> in whatever OS i could boot
[09:43] <kegan_> this is what I can boot
[09:43] <elisaado> try fedora they are friendly xxD
[09:43] <EriC^^> kegan_: did you try dd
[09:43] <kegan_> yes
[09:43] <elisaado> dd is not for iso's?
[09:44] <Ben64> it's not on topic here because we have no information about these random isos you have
[09:44] <Ben64> if it was an ubuntu iso, sure! we know how to do that
[09:44] <eaglebot> elisaado, great of you among peers to answer
[09:44] <elisaado> wow what :O
[09:44] <proxx_> just dd forget all the silly tools, just dd
[09:45] <elisaado> Ben64, they aren't random iso's like kegan_ said
[09:45] <elisaado> i mean
[09:45] <EriC^^> kegan_: there used to be a tool to make windows bootable usb's if that's what it is
[09:45] <EriC^^> winusb i think
[09:45] <kegan_> I came in here almost an hour ago and waited for EriC^^ to finish what he was doing in helping someone else
[09:45] <elisaado> kegan_ said they are the same as from the site
[09:45] <kegan_> and asked my question at an opportune moment
[09:45] <elisaado> and then hell broke loose
[09:46] <kegan_> I'll try that out
[09:46] <kegan_> thank you
[09:46] <elisaado> what, dd?
[09:46] <kegan_> winusb
[09:46] <elisaado> aah
[09:46] <elisaado> btw some chance you're dutch?
[09:46] <kegan_> nope, sorry :)
[09:47] <DeaDSouL_> hi, I have a portable HDD. And I want to be ablt to natively browse its content from Linux/Windows/MacOSX. So, which filesystem I should format it as?
[09:47] <proxx_> hij niet denk ik
[09:47] <elisaado> lel it looked like that
[09:47] <elisaado> lol hi proxx :o
[09:47] <Guest93159> CIFS
[09:47] <Ben64> DeaDSouL_: ntfs probably
[09:47] <UrsaTempest> NTFS I think?
[09:47] <elisaado> anyone talking about ntfs?/?!?!?!?
[09:47] <proxx_> DeaDSouL ntfs or later FAT
[09:48] <proxx_> but I would suggest creating a network FS
[09:48] <elisaado> yeh ntfs and then install ng or smth

[09:51] <proxx_> yeah need register for that
[09:54] <ruind> elisaado, I had to edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
[09:54] <ruind> what a nightmare
[09:54] <proxx_> why dont you put that in the interfaces file ?
[09:57] <elisaado> ruind, aaah
[09:57] <elisaado> wauw
[09:57] <elisaado> proxx_: i am registered
[09:58] <elisaado> munta dutch!

[09:59] <elisaado> yes eh
[10:00] <elisaado> reverse proxy :o
[10:01] <elisaado> but, shall i run ubuntu as a server
[10:01] <elisaado> wait let me explain
[10:01] <proxx_> why not ?
[10:02] <elisaado> I now have a laptop without a screen
[10:02] <elisaado> so i can only boot ubuntu or smth
[10:03] <elisaado> something that supports the second screen
[10:03] <elisaado> but i want to use ubuntu server (ISO)
[10:03] <elisaado> the problem is, when i boot it doesn't recognize my second screen because it is not in a X session
[10:04] <elisaado> and the normal ubuntu has unity and that is a little bit heavy for a 1 gb ram 32 bit laptop
[10:04] <elisaado> any toughts?
[10:04] <Ben64> don't run a laptop as a server
[10:05] <elisaado> it isn't a real laptop anymore
[10:05] <elisaado> it is more a pc
[10:05] <Ben64> except it is still a laptop
[10:05] <elisaado> its a laptop and i removed the screen from it because it didn't work
[10:05] <elisaado> whats wrong they are the same?
[10:05] <proxx_> if you install ssh server you will be able to ssh into it post install , no screen needed
[10:05] <elisaado> thats after installing
[10:06] <proxx_> and use server edition , not desktop
[10:06] <elisaado> i need it while im installing too
[10:06] <Ben64> laptops aren't designed for constantly being on under load
[10:06] <elisaado> yeh thats what i wanted to do proxx :p
[10:06] <elisaado> Ben64, what happens if they are then?
[10:06] <Ben64> overheat, die
[10:06] <proxx_> @Ben64, i have an old laptop running 5 years straight, I get your point but if its 'throw away' hardware , who cares
[10:06] <elisaado> really?
[10:07] <Ben64> anyway just install lubuntu or something and run it without gui
[10:07] <elisaado> yeh lubuntu!
[10:07] <elisaado> you're smart
[10:07] <proxx_> if you wanna be really difficult you could preinstall the disk in another machine  , then swap the drives
[10:07] <elisaado> hmm
[10:08] <elisaado> thats a good idea too
[10:08] <proxx_> annoying but effective
[10:08] <elisaado> but it needs to be a machine with the same specs?
[10:08] <proxx_> no , linux dont care
[10:08] <elisaado> ah
[10:08] <elisaado> okay
[10:09] <proxx_> windows cries about such things, most distros will run like it never knew other hw
[10:09] <elisaado> me "Shall i run archlinux as a server"
[10:09] <elisaado> random guy "No."
[10:09] <elisaado> proxx_, wow i didn't know that
[10:09] <proxx_> well if you have to ask then no is probably the best answer
[10:09] <elisaado> hahaha
[10:10] <elisaado> wow another guy said that
[10:10] <elisaado> wow
[10:10] <proxx_> arch can be really stable depening on your choices , i run arch on many boxes, still one of my favo distros
[10:11] <elisaado> same
[10:11] <proxx_> I know a dude who has a whole server farm on gentoo
[10:11] <elisaado> gentoo?!
[10:11] <elisaado> server!?
[10:11] <Ben64> try to keep on topic
[10:11] <elisaado> oh yeh
[10:11] <proxx_> yeah we trying , this sorta is
[10:11] <Ben64> it isn't
[10:11] <elisaado> lel
[10:12] <elisaado> it is
[10:12] <elisaado> we are talking from a ubuntu VM xD
[10:12] <elisaado> me *
[10:13] <elisaado> but imma brb
[10:13] <elisaado> im making a windows iso first
[10:13] <elisaado> then a lubuntu iso
[10:13] <elisaado> i mean
[10:13] <elisaado> burning them
[10:25] <evanescode> fire
[10:25] <evanescode> crap, wrong window my bad
[10:26] <elisaado> welp
[10:27] <ij> Are php extensions enabled by default
[10:27] <ij> *?
[10:28] <wafflejock> ij, enabled for what?
[10:29] <ij> If I install e.g. php7.0 from the ondrej's ppa, will they be enabled by default when using php cli or fpm?
[10:29] <wafflejock> ij, typically you would install some web server and install a module for the web server and maybe enable the module if it isn't
=== sins-_y is now known as sins-
[10:30] <wafflejock> ij, the fpm daemon will be running after the install but don't recall if it auto enables or configures, the cli will be available since php binary will be on the path but depending on nginx or apache or whatever may need a bit more config
[10:31] <evanescode> ij: if your using apache2 you need to install and a2enmod the php module
[10:32] <ij> I'm cli/fpm only. I see, thanks.

[11:00] <k1l_> kwirc: because you set that to on in the system settings.

[11:01] <kwirc> wtf
[11:01] <kwirc> how do I turn it off?
[11:01] <k1l_> go to the system settings
[11:01] <kwirc> this is some messed up shit
[11:02] <ubuntugrl> how do i change my wallpaper, i want bunnies on it
[11:02] <kwirc> i thought linux wasf ree why do I have advertisements in it?
[11:02] <k1l_> ubuntugrl: like you do it on every OS. right click the desktop and choose another wallpaper you like.
[11:03] <k1l_> kwirc: stop trying to make drama out of it. its set to "opt in" since 16.04, so you set it to on.
[11:04] <kwirc> k11 then why dont you go and run a proprietary os if i am making an drama out of it
[11:04]  * brunch875 sighs profoundly
[11:04] <cfhowlett> kwirc, enough. your question has been asked and answered.   move on.
[11:05] <kwirc> you know what I am going to remove this whole ubuntu crap
[11:05] <evanescode> well there was quite a drama about the whole shopping lenses fubar when they were introduced
[11:05] <evanescode> its still a valid concern imho
[11:05] <cfhowlett> it's opt in. i.e.completely under user control.
[11:06] <k1l_> evanescode: its not enabled on default since 16.04. so a user who enables that and then comes in here to make drama about it. its too obvious.
[11:07] <evanescode> out of interest: do things like that change when you do-release-upgrade?
[11:07] <evanescode> ie you had it enabled pre 16.04, then upgrade to the next LTS. does it change your user prefs and settings?
[11:07] <k1l_> iirc it says the way it was
[11:08] <evanescode> i see, thx
[11:09] <ubuntugrl> itt will try to do it best it can
[11:09] <ubuntugrl> some pkgs have config changes

[11:13] <uio> I was downloading lubuntu 16.04.1 but the download stopped at 502 MB... so I started another dowload of the same file and it is advancing... is there a server issue?
[11:13] <uio> I am using this link http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/xenial/release/lubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-i386.iso
[11:14] <wadda> i have installed windows after ubuntu and my encrypted. I can't install grub ob my hdd again.
[11:14] <k1l_> uio: is there a reason why you install 32bit OS?
[11:14] <cfhowlett> uio, possibly.  however, you will find torrents a more reliable and possibly faster option than direct DL
[11:14] <uio> cfhowlett: Okay, thanks.
[11:15] <uio> k1l_: What would be the most logical reason?
[11:15] <wadda> cfhowlett: any idea hoq to solve my issue?
[11:15] <k1l_> uio: the only reason would be, that its an old CPU that only can handle 32bit. other than that there is no reason
[11:15] <uio> k1l_: Exactly :)
[11:17] <k1l_> uio: i am just asking, because a lot of 32bit users in here did install it due to wrong ram myths like 64bit doesnt work for systems with <4GB ram or such. :)
[11:18] <uio> k1l_: Yes, thanks for letting me know. It is true that it would be shame to use 32 on a 64. Oh, this machine is a wee bit elderly.
[11:19] <alkisg> 64bit does waste more RAM though, so with e.g. 1 GB of RAM and 64bit processor, I would still use i386
[11:19] <uio> alkisg: interesting.
[11:20] <k1l_> alkisg: "wasting ram" vs "more bandwith". with 1gb ram i would use zram anyway.
[11:20] <uio> alkisg: This machine only has 1GB of RAM and is 32 bit...
[11:20] <alkisg> zram wastes a whole lot of cpu
[11:20] <k1l_> alkisg: well, with a that old machine with that less ram, you gotta die some way anyway :)
[11:20] <alkisg> uio: we have thousands of those, running ubuntu mate 32bit with nbd swap
[11:20] <cfhowlett> or use lubuntu
[11:21] <uio> cfhowlett: I actually am going to use lubuntu, thanks for the suggestion though.

[11:48] <Not_a_Robot> Guys, I need to hibernate my pc. But for that, it seems I need Swap. Creating Swap is not a problem (I don't have Swap because I just don't need it). The issue here is that I only have an SSD. Is there a way I could use Swap JUST for hibernation, please?
[11:49] <brainwash> Not_a_Robot: adjust this parameter then https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness
[11:50] <brunch875> afterkeys: from what I'm reading over the internet, you need to obtain a cloak from freenode (the IRC server we're connected to). You could join #freenode and ask there for a cloak. Perhaps some staff member grants you one :)
[11:50] <brunch875> you might want to register your nickname first
[11:51] <afterkeys> lol  ok
[11:51] <Not_a_Robot> thank you brainwash but, how do I tell "just for hibernation"?
[11:55] <stevlar> Not_a_Robot u are asking that to avoid writing data to ssd?

[11:55] <Not_a_Robot> I just want to be able to hibernate my computer without using Swap
[11:55] <Not_a_Robot> but since it is not possible
[11:55] <Not_a_Robot> I just want to use Swap for Hibernation
[11:55] <wafflejock> Not_a_Robot, just set it to 0 it will basically not use it
[11:55] <ioria> correct me.... suspend it's from ram, hibernation from disk .... ?
[11:55] <Not_a_Robot> yes ioria
[11:56] <Not_a_Robot> So... Do you think ubuntu will use swap, even in that setting, wafflejock?
[11:56] <Sillypirato> Not_a_Robot why would u care
[11:56] <Not_a_Robot> Sillypirato: about what?
[11:56] <Sillypirato> it will only swap at overflow situations
[11:56] <wafflejock> Not_a_Robot, based on what it says here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swappiness will only be used in that scenario when absolutely needed
[11:56] <brainwash> Not_a_Robot: it will when you run out of memory
[11:56] <Not_a_Robot> I have 32GiB of RAM
[11:56] <stevlar> wow
[11:56] <wafflejock> Not_a_Robot, can check with `free -m` to see if it is used at all
[11:57] <stevlar> u will never use swap :D
[11:57] <Sillypirato> so until you run outta mem it wont be used
[11:57] <brainwash> then it's not very likely that it happens
[11:57] <stevlar> with that much memory
[11:57] <stevlar> just set the swappiness to 0
[11:57] <stevlar> and u're good to go
[11:57] <Not_a_Robot> I have Zero Swap, wafflejock. I installed it that way because of that reason.
[11:57] <Sillypirato> only reason apart from hibernation is when using db's

[11:58] <ioria> Not_a_Robot, oh
[11:58] <wafflejock> have swapiness at the default of 60 so imagine with 0 you'll be fine
[11:59] <Not_a_Robot> I'm just "afraid" if some applications will not care about setting Swappines to 0
[11:59] <wafflejock> Not_a_Robot, well it's a kernel level thing so don't think the apps have a choice in it

[12:00] <Sillypirato> there are other things to look at if its more performance you seek

[12:03] <leeyaa> hello
[12:04] <leeyaa> on ubuntu 16.04 LTS i can see that part of default mount options appears to be data=ordered
[12:04] <leeyaa> on 14.04 LTS nodes I dont have it - what is the default option there ?
[12:05] <leeyaa> trying to figure out why mounts differ between two nodes
[12:05] <ikonia> "defaults" is the default option
[12:05] <leeyaa> ikonia: one sec ill be specific
[12:06] <leeyaa> ikonia: on both nodes I have ext4 noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro 0 1 in fstab
[12:06] <ikonia> ok
[12:07] <leeyaa> however, on 16.04 node, mount returns rw,noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered
[12:07] <ikonia> ok ?
[12:07] <leeyaa> and on 14.04 it returns rw,noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro
[12:07] <leeyaa> why? my fstab is the same
[12:08] <ikonia> coreutils has more options and data ordering is default in the later version ?
[12:08] <ikonia> check what version of coreutils brings in the ordering
[12:08] <leeyaa> oh
[12:08] <leeyaa> ok so the older version does not data=ordered
[12:08] <leeyaa> what is being used then ?
[12:09] <ikonia> I don't know if it's the version, I'm giving you a suggestion to research
[12:09] <leeyaa> i see
[12:09] <ikonia> probably nothing is being used as it wasn't supported in the older version (guessing)
[12:09] <leeyaa> right
[12:09] <ubuntu347> Hello can anyone help me satisfy this dependency? Error: Dependency is not satisfiable: libqt5core5a(>=5.5.0). I'm trying to install chessx 1.4.0-1  in trusty.
[12:09] <leeyaa> doesnt it fall back to something is nothing is being used ?
[12:09] <leeyaa> im confused
[12:09] <ikonia> leeyaa: why would it fall back to something that doesn't exist ?
[12:10] <ikonia> ordering may not existing the earlier version (again - I'm guessing I don't know)
[12:10] <ikonia> ubuntu347: look at where chessx is coming from
[12:10] <leeyaa> it does.
[12:10] <leeyaa> the thing is node is suffering huge performance hit and thats the only difference i found
[12:10] <leeyaa> but i doubt ordering can cause it
[12:11] <ubuntu347> How do I do that? I think I downloaded from a git  page.
[12:11] <leeyaa> anyway thanks for the tip
[12:11] <ikonia> ubuntu347: so then you need to talk to whom built it
[12:11] <ikonia> leeyaa: how do you know it does ?
[12:11] <leeyaa> ikonia: two identical vms - one 14.04 one 16.04. on 16.04 mysql got to crawling speed
[12:12] <leeyaa> right now im testing what happens if i install 5.7 on 14.04 node
[12:12] <leeyaa> maybe mysql changed something
[12:12] <ikonia> leeyaa: I'm not trying to be argumentative, but you've just stated you don't know the options and how they differ, I've just suggested one is a later version and may support later features, and you seem to suggest the earlier version supports those features too
[12:12] <leeyaa> if i change fstab options a bit i get the performance i expect, but i really dont want to use no barrier etc
[12:12] <ikonia> leeyaa: why is mysql crawling, where is the bottleneck
[12:12] <leeyaa> ikonia: io
[12:12] <Anarchic> i have issues installing ubuntu 16.10 in efi mode...booting from memory stick in efi mode works as normal...manual partitioning with efi partition works as normal...installation completes as normal, but on reboot there is no efi boot entry in my efi...any ideas?
[12:13] <ikonia> leeyaa: in what way IO, access, wait, throughput, read, write etc etc
[12:13] <leeyaa> but thats not the root cause, something is causing mysql to use more io
[12:13] <leeyaa> ikonia: writes are a lot slower
[12:13] <leeyaa> a lot
[12:13] <leeyaa> like 60-70%
[12:13] <ikonia> leeyaa: how are you measuring that
[12:13] <ubuntu347> Well I was able to install it on my laptop using zenia. i didn't have to talk to anybody about it. Trusty is proving difficult
[12:13] <leeyaa> ikonia: using our app. it is a sandbox - so i create accounts via our app
[12:13] <leeyaa> on 5.5 it takes X time
[12:14] <leeyaa> on 5.6 i takes X3 time
[12:14] <ikonia> leeyaa: how are you measuing that writes are %60 slower
[12:14] <leeyaa> erm 5.7*
[12:14] <leeyaa> nothing else differs, just ubuntu release and mysql release
[12:15] <leeyaa> anyway, ill test 5.7 on 14.04
[12:15] <leeyaa> then 5.5 on 16.04
[12:15] <leeyaa> at least this will narrow it down
[12:15] <ikonia> I think you'd do better to understand the problem more
[12:15] <ikonia> swapping versions doesn't seem like a sensible way forward
[12:15] <leeyaa> ikonia: well too many variables are changed (whole os)
[12:16] <ikonia> you just said it's just the ubuntu version and mysql like it was no big deal
[12:16] <leeyaa> problem is either with ubuntu env somewhere or with mysql env
[12:16] <ikonia> understand what part of IO is performing poor and why first
[12:16] <ikonia> swapping versions won't tell you much if you don't understand the problem
[12:17] <farhad> can i use rsnapshot by command?
[12:17] <leeyaa> just not sure where to start lol
=== Tempesta_ is now known as Tempesta
[12:17] <ikonia> leeyaa: ok - so understanding the problem is the first place
[12:17] <ikonia> leeyaa: you state that IO is the problem, fine, zero in on that, you state that writes are the problem, is it just writes, or reads too, it is just mysql writes or file system writes or even device writes
[12:17] <ikonia> how are you measuring it
[12:18] <leeyaa> ikonia: i see your point
[12:18] <ikonia> leeyaa: not trying to stop you - however my opinion is that changing variables without understanding the problem won't help you, it will add more confusion
[12:19] <leeyaa> ikonia: yeah
[12:19] <leeyaa> i guess starting a bit lower is better - test the fs, then test mysql itself
[12:19] <ikonia> leeyaa: work out how to measure what mysql is doing, and what mysql thinks it's doing
[12:19] <ikonia> you'll probably find that is useful to understand
[12:19] <leeyaa> ikonia: the way i measure mysql performance is just doing stuff with our app - create accounts, delete accoutns etc
[12:20] <ikonia> leeyaa: and a clock next to it ?
[12:20] <leeyaa> ikonia: well, no, but i didnt need it. the slower environment was not working at all due to internal timeouts - so i know it is ~3 times slower
[12:20] <Not_a_Robot> ioria: <3
[12:21] <ikonia> leeyaa: ok, I would suggest your first point would be to run analysier tools on the DB
[12:21] <ikonia> look at what it's doing, then look at where the DB is having problems and relate that to the box/devices
[12:21] <ioria> Not_a_Robot,  success ?
[12:21] <eaglebot> What is the command for upgrading trusty too utopic?
[12:22] <leeyaa> ikonia: what do you mean by analysier tools - never used such
[12:22] <ikonia> there are tools that analyse the way the db is working / what it's doing and giving you hints of whats going on
[12:23] <ikonia> some are from mysql some are third party
[12:24] <leeyaa> ikonia: ok i think i understand now
[12:24] <leeyaa> thanks a lot for all those tips!

[12:40] <ioria> uio  let's check ... can you provide   sudo parted -l ?
[12:40] <leeyaa> ikonia: on fs level it appears that 16.04 is a bit faster (creating 100k files archiving those 100k files and creating 5x1GB files)
[12:40] <leeyaa> so ill take your tip and run some analysing on mysql
[12:40] <Southern_Gentlem> ioria one way to check would be sudo fdisk -l  and get the output to a pastebin
[12:41] <ioria> Southern_Gentlem,  sure

[14:07] <Sillypirato> uio i suggest creating an extended part first
[14:07] <uio> Sillypirato: but I haven't a clue how to do this manually....
[14:07] <Sillypirato> uio that is if you want swap , do you ?
[14:07] <rorro> Soul_Sample, I will try that.
[14:07] <uio> Sillypirato: what is extended?
[14:07] <uio> Sillypirato: ext2?
[14:07] <Sillypirato> uio its a container in which you can put more partitions
[14:08] <rorro> oh wow, it worked. Thanks so much Soul_Sample.
[14:08] <Soul_Sample> rorro: no problem :D glad I helped
[14:08] <Sillypirato> uio but if you dont need swap we can move from here
[14:08] <uio> Sillypirato: And there is no way to just get the simpl 'alongside' option. If not, I'm up for another go I gues....
[14:08] <uio> Sillypirato: yes, swap. Okay, what do I do?
[14:09] <Sillypirato> uio the reason the installer doesnt give the option is because there is no free space
[14:09] <uio> Sillypirato: gparted?
[14:09] <uio> Sillypirato: But it is freespace!!
[14:09] <Sillypirato> uio you could remove the ext2 and let the installer do its magic
[14:09] <Sillypirato> uio you just said you made it ext2
[14:10] <Sillypirato> so you can either tell the installer , use this. or remove the whole thing and hope the installer will give you the extra option
[14:11] <gvandeweyer> hi all, does anybody have a good suggestion (can be commercial) for a windows-based backup tool that is able to handle linux symlinks correctly? We have a windows servers which hosts a NFS share. Some users put symlinks on it to reduce storage for duplicate files. Now apparently, they don't get copied to the replicate server by windows.
[14:11] <uio_> Sillypirato: I am back, sorry wifi
[14:11] <stranglerfish> hrm, anyone have any ideas as to why that script isn't working?
[14:11] <uio_> Sillypirato: No, I made it FAT32
[14:12] <uio_> Sillypirato: How can I make it 'empty' so the 'alongside option will appear?
[14:12] <Sillypirato> uio ah oke , no remove that crap and try installer again , just make sure you have the freespace
[14:12] <uio_> Sillypirato: How do I remove it?
=== crash is now known as Guest60160
[14:12] <Sillypirato> uio by deleting it, it will then be named 'unallocated space' , oh click it in gparted and do remove , menu is pretty logical

[14:14] <Sillypirato> Eric^^ is that a recent ip block ?
[14:14] <EriC^^> Sillypirato: hmm?
[14:14] <EriC^^> whatcha talkin about
[14:15] <MangaD> Hello
[14:15] <Sillypirato> Eric^^ oh nothing, i know RIPE is giving out that IP block , amogst the last few
[14:15] <NoImNotNineVolt> haven't we been hearing that for a decade now?
[14:15] <MangaD> I have a weird problem with Ubuntu, hoping someone can enlight me...
[14:15] <EriC^^> what's RIPE?
[14:15] <Sillypirato> whatever you heard , this is about it
[14:16] <EriC^^> MangaD: ask away
[14:16] <daddle> type your problem plz ?
[14:17] <daddle> someone know command to restart rights management ?
[14:17] <MangaD> Well, I updated from 16.04 to 16.10 recently. Some problems happened during the update but I think I fixed them. When I typed "lsb_release -a" it would say I have 16.10 yakkety. But now it says I have 17.04 zesty...
[14:17] <Sillypirato> I heard something similar today
[14:17] <MangaD> I just upgraded "distro-info-data", not sure if it is related...
[14:18] <Pici> MangaD: How did you upgrade?
[14:18] <Sillypirato> seems upgrade bug
[14:18] <MangaD> through Software Updater at first
[14:18] <Pici> MangaD: at first?
[14:18] <daddle> oh ok nvm admin toksudo anyways
[14:18] <MangaD> then it got bugged (PC froze) and I shutdown
=== cy is now known as Guest25571
[14:18] <MangaD> so I manually upgraded the packages with sudo apt upgrade then
[14:19] <MangaD> all seemed fine aside from certain third party software not having release files for yakkety now
[14:19] <Sillypirato> MangaD some other guy had the same thing here today
[14:19] <Soul_Sample> is there a chance for a newer version of nautilus to come to 16.04 in the next point release?
[14:19] <ikonia> doubtful
[14:19] <ikonia> why do you want a newer version ?
[14:19] <uio> Sillypirato: wifi... Okay, thanks! the alongside option appeared and I am now installing!
[14:19] <MangaD> Yeah I am worried this problem can screw things up on my system now. :/
[14:20] <MangaD> Like adding reps for a distro that is not released yet...
[14:20] <Soul_Sample> ikonia: when I tried 3.20 recently it looked so much better, icon spacing was fixed and had some nice additions. I'm not even sure if 16.10 has 3.20 though
[14:20] <MangaD> http://i.imgur.com/tUM0B6i.png
[14:20] <ikonia> Soul_Sample: I'd be very very surprised if it got a version bump, so I wouldn't expect it
[14:21] <MangaD> could it be because I have Ubuntu toolchain repository?
[14:21] <cerion> is LSB still relevant ?
[14:22] <NoImNotNineVolt> yes, very much so.
[14:22] <ikonia> yes]
[14:22] <Pici> MangaD: which repo is that exactly?
[14:22] <cerion> debian dropped in sept 2015. ok
[14:22] <MangaD> Pici, ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
[14:22] <MangaD> I used it to install gcc 6 previously
[14:23] <MangaD> but I never had problems of this sort
[14:23] <cerion> with snap it should be totally irrelevant now
[14:24] <ikonia> cerion: snap is not a replacement
[14:24] <ikonia> it's an options
[14:24] <cerion> ok
[14:24] <Pici> MangaD: Yes. There was a recent change to base-files in that repo that updated things to Zesty: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-toolchain-r/+archive/ubuntu/test/+packages?field.name_filter=&field.status_filter=published&field.series_filter=yakkety

[14:27] <Tiger__> Is it fine to install 16.10? or should i wait?
[14:27] <Pici> MangaD: Manaully replace the package with the one from 16.10 and look up how to pin the version from 16.10... or install the version from 16.10 and remove the PPA if you don't need any more gcc-6 updates
[14:27] <jaythelinuxguy> Tiger__ is there something in particular you hope to gain from an upgrade to 16.10?
[14:28] <jaythelinuxguy> My recomendation is to stay on 16.04 unless you have a specific use-case to upgrade.
[14:28] <Tiger__> jaythelinuxguy: just putting it on a disk, as i might be having to re-install ubuntu anyway
[14:28] <jaythelinuxguy> Tiger__ Unless you have a specific use-case, I'd stick with 16.04, it's supported for a longer period of time.
[14:28] <Tiger__> jaythelinuxguy:makes sense. thanks
[14:29] <jaythelinuxguy> Tiger__ when are you planning on reinstalling?
[14:29] <MangaD> Pici, all right, thank you ^^
[14:30] <Tiger__> jaythelinuxguy: maybe today. to straighten out my install
[14:30] <Tiger__> possibly tommorow, or maybe later this week, maybe next week lol
[14:30] <uio> Sillypirato: Hello, ran into a proble, apparently it's impossible to install GRUB on sda4....
[14:30] <jaythelinuxguy> Tiger__ I was asking because 16.04.2 will probably have the newer kernel from 16.10. However, you can install the new kernel after 16.04.2 comes out so you can still install now.
[14:31] <EriC^^> uio: what's the problem maybe i can help
[14:31] <uio> EriC^^: Hi, just trying an install dual boot with Windows7
[14:31] <Reuben> I'm having some problems on my Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS after unlocking my encrypted drive. The error is something like this: /run/lvm/lvmetad.socket: connect failed: no such file or directory It will continue to boot fine but just concerned on what's going on cause it would not boot in the normal login screen but I had to disable that screen and do it via the command line.
[14:31] <stranglerfish> can someone please help me understand why my script is not working? i've been struggling with this for hours now and I feel it really shouldn't be so difficult
[14:31] <MangaD> Another question. Regarding WINE. "it looks like wine32-development is missing, you should install it.
[14:31] <MangaD> as root, please execute "apt-get install wine32-development""
[14:31] <Sillypirato> uio well it since if this is legacy boot , the mbr should always be on the beginning
[14:32] <MangaD> But I cannot install wine32-development on 64-bit system...
[14:32] <Reuben> http://paste.ubuntu.com/23343933/ are the relevant logs and errors, really really appreciate someone's help
[14:32] <uio> EriC^^: I selected 'alongside' but now it is not wanted to put GRUB
[14:32] <EriC^^> uio: hmm why not did it say why?
[14:32] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben, I wish I could help, I've not seen that error on my end yet so I have no experience yet.
[14:32] <uio> EriC^^: Not that I can see now...
[14:33] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: thanks i did a google and did find some instructions which may be relevant to me but I have no idea what they're saying tbh
[14:33] <EriC^^> uio: btw if you do reinstall ubuntu, don't choose to reinstall, it'll wipe your whole hdd, it happened to me once
[14:33] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben, what articles did you find?
[14:33] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: http://askubuntu.com/questions/745218/ubuntu-wont-boot-because-of-lvmetad
[14:33] <EriC^^> uio: is it giving an error before the install starts or at the end of the install?
[14:33] <uio> EriC^^: it just says it cannot put the booter on the desired location and gives the option of seleting a new parition or qutting or just continuing without at booter
[14:34] <uio> EriC^^: this is well into the install
[14:34] <EriC^^> uio: before it starts copying the files and stuff though, right?
[14:34] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: they were saying to just use_lvmetad = 0 in lvm.conf but I don't know if that's wise.
[14:34] <uio> EriC^^: nope, after
[14:34] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben, do you have a swap partition active? If you do free -m, does it show swap?
[14:34] <EriC^^> uio: oh
[14:34] <ioria> uio, not  sda4  but /dev/sda , i think you wrong selected it in the installer
[14:34] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: let me check
[14:35] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: yes there's a swap
[14:35] <EriC^^> uio: ioria he said he chose alongside windows, odd eh?
[14:35] <Reuben> says total 8703 used 17 and free 8686
[14:35] <ioria> EriC^^, i guess
[14:35] <EriC^^> uio: did you try to manually partition in the Something else menu?
[14:35] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben, in that case, I'm not really sure. I've never ran into an lvmetad issue before. Which is strange, because I use LVM with encryption on all my machines now.
[14:36] <uio> EriC^^: no, but I did free up space with gparted and some utilitin in Windows
[14:36] <uio> EriC^^: Should I just continue without the booter and then use boot repair??
[14:36] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: Could u check my ubuntu pastse to see if my fstab entries are correct cause i noticed some parts are commented out (i can't remember why they are)
[14:36] <EriC^^> uio: try the Something else menu, and let the bootloader location at the bottom be /dev/sda
[14:37] <EriC^^> uio: use the partition ubuntu already made for "/" and swap
[14:37] <EriC^^> uio: if you want, did it just skip grub or aborted the whole install there?
[14:38] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: and crypttab cryptswap is also commented out. Crypttab is referring to sda3_crypt with UUID 7609 etc etc but in fstab that UUID is sda3 and not sda3_crypt
[14:38] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: so just wondering if there's an issue there?
[14:39] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben, I can look at it. Btw, which ubuntu version are you using?
[14:39] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: It's 16.04.1 LTS http://paste.ubuntu.com/23343933/ is the stuff
[14:40] <jaythelinuxguy> It's very curious that your swap stuff is commented out, yet you still have swap
[14:41] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: well there's a mounted swap file at /mnt/8704MiB.swap
[14:41] <Reuben> that's in fstab
[14:42] <jaythelinuxguy> That's an odd place for swap, one moment
[14:42] <jaythelinuxguy> The fstab entry for swap on my machine looks like this: /dev/mapper/ubuntu--mate--vg-swap_1 none            swap    sw              0       0
[14:44] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: i'm not sure if this is the result of following this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04
[14:44] <jaythelinuxguy> Are you using the server edition? Usually when you install Ubuntu and ask it to encrypt your drive, it does all this for you.
[14:45] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: desktop edition it has UI interface. I can't really remember how i did this :( was a long while ago and actually it broke when i upgraded versions from 14 to 16
[14:45] <OerHeks> looks like sda3 is cryptswap ?
[14:45] <Reuben> yeah i'm not sure what's the meaning of sda3 and sda3_crypt and which one I should be referring to in crypttab
[14:46] <epascoal> hi all.. i update my ubuntu from 14.04 to 16 and not i can't load ubuntu anymore.. Is there a way to restore my previous version?
[14:46] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: I vaguely remember earlier versions of Ubuntu having issues with swap on LUKS encrypted installations. That bug was fixed later on. That could be why you did it that way.
[14:46] <uio> EriC^^: wifi cut out... Okay, so I quit the install process, but have no clue what to do and am ready to damn ubuntu!
[14:46] <epascoal> i'm doing a usb stick to install it again on 14 version..
[14:46] <Reuben> also i didn't want to use my SSD as a swapfile
[14:47] <Reuben> so i think i might have created the swap in a different drive
[14:47] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: You could try commenting out that swap line, rebooting, and seeing if that works. I wouldn't leave it that way though, I would re-enable it. Just would be curious to see if the errors go away if you comment that out.
[14:47] <EriC^^> uio: wb
[14:47] <EriC^^> uio: ok, try to reinstall with the something else option
[14:47] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: There's no logical reason to create swap on a different partition, I would be more worried about your browser wearing out your SSD than swap
[14:47] <jaythelinuxguy> *different drive I meant
[14:48] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: don't really use the browser on that computer
[14:48] <uio> ererlay, I'm there
[14:48] <EriC^^> and if the grub issue happens again let it continue and you can reinstall grub afterwards
[14:48] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: uncomment in fstab and crypttab?
[14:48] <EriC^^> uio: ok, choose at the bottom bootloader location /dev/sda
[14:48] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: It's probably more beneficial to adjust swappiness than to make swap go to a different drive
[14:48] <uio> EriC^^: but how do I do a mnual install
[14:48] <Reuben> vm.swappiness=10 at the moment
[14:48] <EriC^^> and click on the ext4 partition of ubuntu and choose mountpoint "/" ext4 and press the button for format next to it
[14:48] <EriC^^> uio: go to something else at the bottom
[14:49] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: On second thought, I'm a bit nervious to have you do that because you followed a tutorial and not had it managed by Ubuntu. I don't want you to get in a situation where it won't boot.
[14:49] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: how do i check which drive my /mnt/8704MiB.swap is on ?
[14:49] <uio> EriC^^: okay, I'm there
[14:49] <jaythelinuxguy> Type: mount |grep swap
[14:49] <uio> EriC^^: what partition should I choose?
[14:49] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: nothing comes up
[14:50] <jaythelinuxguy> Maybe: mount |grep sw
[14:50] <uio> EriC^^: It wants a root partition....
[14:50] <Reuben> nothing either
[14:50] <EriC^^> uio: choose the ubuntu one that's ext4
[14:50] <jaythelinuxguy> Or tell me what's in /etc/mtab
[14:50] <EriC^^> there should be one ext4 and one swap
[14:51] <jaythelinuxguy> What is the output of mount without grepping? What's in /etc/mtab? Those places may hold clues as to where your swap is
[14:51] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: http://paste.ubuntu.com/23344035/
[14:51] <uio> EriC^^: Sorry, yes both those are thre, but how do I choose to use them?
[14:51] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: this is mount http://paste.ubuntu.com/23344040/
[14:52] <uio> EriC^^: I just highlight it? the ext4 I mean...
[14:52] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: It's looking to me so far as if you're using a swap file, not a swap partition
[14:52] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: yes that's right only a swap file
[14:52] <EriC^^> uio: double click on the ext4 one
[14:52] <EriC^^> and choose mountpoint "/" and ext4 as the filesystem
[14:53] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: Although it may not be an issue, I don't like the swap file being in the /mnt directory. I usually create swap files right at /, for example, /swapfile
[14:53] <EriC^^> also for swap double click and choose swap partiton
[14:53] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: hmmm
[14:54] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: lol maybe let's deal with one issue at a time haha
[14:55] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: For a moment I was thinking it may be contributing to your issue. You're probably right though.
[14:56] <uio> EriC^^: Okay, so I double click on the ext4, but I son't see what I must do after that
[14:56] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: But the only thing that seems out of place to me, though, is how you have swap set up. Ubuntu 14.04 had issues with setting up swap during installation when using encryption. That was fixed later. Unfortuately that  is the only thing that seems odd to me about your setup
[14:56] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: i have a feeling that there wwas a bug with the encrypted shit
[14:56] <Reuben> that's why there is all these hacky workarouinds
[14:57] <uio> EriC^^: okay, got it for ext4
[14:57] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: My experience with 14.04 and encryption was that it worked well, other than swap. I remember swap working the first boot, and then not again after that.
[14:57] <uio> EriC^^: What should I do with the swap one?
[14:57] <uio> eric
[14:57] <uio> EriC^^: sorry, mouse slip
[14:57] <OerHeks> Reuben,  encrypted swap is oke, you just would heave issues when going hybernating/sleep
[14:58] <OerHeks> if that happened, your system could not get awake
[14:58] <uio> EriC^^: and then I should choose what for the location of the booter?
[14:58] <jaythelinuxguy> OerHeks encrypted swap is fine, I agree, but it was broken in 14.04.
[14:58] <Reuben> maybe i should just install from scratch
[14:58] <ioria> uio, /dev/sda
[14:59] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: If you're going to do that anyway, it probably won't hurt to comment out that swapfile line in fstab, just to see whether or not it fixes it.
[14:59] <uio> ioria: for the booter? and what do I do with the wee swap partition that the last attempt birthed?
[14:59] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: Have your livecd ready beforehand, obviously
[14:59] <Reuben> haha yes
[14:59] <ioria> uio, sorry, i got booloader
[14:59] <ioria> uio, *bootloader
[15:00] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: also, move that swapfile somewhere else before rebooting
[15:00] <EriC^^> uio: double click on it and choose swap partition
[15:00] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy and OerHeks: thanks :D
[15:00] <Reuben> appreciate it!
[15:00] <Reuben> will probably save this for a weekend job
[15:00] <Reuben> :D
[15:00] <uio> EriC^^: okay, and then I just click install?
[15:00] <Reuben> Thanks so much guysss
[15:00] <gambl0re> why do i need to run sudo command every time i want to do any command even something as createing an empty file?
[15:00] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: Msg me about how it goes
[15:00] <gambl0re> or creating a dir
[15:01] <ioria> uio,  check grub location selected
[15:01] <Reuben> jaythelinuxguy: will do :D will come back here later on thx!!
[15:01] <EriC^^> uio: yuo
[15:01] <OerHeks> good safety, gambl0re
[15:01] <uio> EriC^^: I couldn't choose a mount point for swap, so I changed nothing...
[15:01] <jaythelinuxguy> Reuben: np
[15:01] <uio> ioria: there is no grub
[15:01] <EriC^^> uio: yeah no mountpoint needed
[15:01] <EriC^^> uio: clcik on
[15:01] <EriC^^> format next to the ext4 one
[15:01] <EriC^^> on the checkmark next to it
[15:02] <uio> EriC^^: format the swap space to ext4?
[15:03] <uio> EriC^^: format the swap space to ext4 and selected the mount point
[15:03] <uio> EriC^^: then I ticked off its box
[15:03] <uio> EriC^^: now I turn swap into ext4 and check its format box?
[15:05] <uio> ioria: does that sound right to you? I should turn swap into ext4
[15:05] <EriC^^> uio: no i meant the ext4 that has the mountpoint "/"
[15:06] <uio> EriC^^: I did that, and checked the 'format' box for it.
[15:06] <EriC^^> oh ok cool
[15:06] <EriC^^> install away :D
[15:06] <uio> EriC^^: Do I leave the swap one alone?
[15:06] <EriC^^> yeah

[15:11] <EriC^^> i do know you can create a user with home encryption later, i'm not sure if it creates an encrypted swap with that
[15:11] <rcmainak> what is wrong with my software center? it can't find steam neither in installed app section nor as search result...
[15:11] <uio> EriC^^: This is why windows users don't come to linux!
[15:12] <Sillypirato> popMaize oke , so try this ; telnet thehostyouwheretalkingabout 22
[15:12] <EriC^^> uio: bugs happen, c'est la vie :D
[15:12] <eaglebot> what command runs an upgrade from trusty too utopic?
[15:12] <EriC^^> uio: try without home encryption then add it later maybe
[15:12] <uio> EriC^^: C'est la vie indeed
[15:12] <popMaize> Sillypirato, "telnet: command no found"
[15:13] <EriC^^> it should be easy to add the encryption
[15:13] <uio> EriC^^: alas

[15:14] <Gustavo6046> Hi :D
[15:14] <Gustavo6046> What screen is that?
[15:15] <OerHeks> Gustavo6046, your screen?
[15:15] <Gustavo6046> :D
[15:15] <Gustavo6046> Yes but
[15:15] <Gustavo6046> what is that garbling? Why is it in MS-DOS text mode?
[15:15] <Gustavo6046> Ah, nevermind.
[15:15] <popMaize> What's weird is that I know I've ssh'd into one of there servers before like a month or two ago... so...
[15:16] <meetunix> what is network, server, and channels ?
[15:16] <ioria> uio, you can encrypt your home and swap later
[15:17] <uio> Dear ubuntu channel: desbite several hours of effort I was unable to install linux on a windows machine. If you ever wonder why people don't make the jump to linux, this might be why.
[15:17] <meetunix> how can i enlist all networks, servers, and channels ?
[15:17] <NoImNotNineVolt> enlist in what?
[15:17] <OerHeks> meetunix, depends on your irc client
[15:17] <meetunix> and how can i connect or join them
[15:18] <meetunix> i m using irssi
[15:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> oh. there are many networks/servers, and not all of them are public.
[15:18] <mjayk> uio: thats for the update :), you might find this channel more useful if you ask a question.
[15:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#Networks
[15:18] <NoImNotNineVolt> that's a partial list of some of the larger networks.
[15:18] <OerHeks> !irssi | good start > meetunix
[15:18] <ubottu> meetunix, please see my private message
[15:18] <Pici> !alis > meetunix
[15:18] <uio> mjayk: look at the history of the channel. I have been
[15:19] <meetunix> @ubottu i dont know still how to i m still total new
[15:19] <mjayk> uio: my appologies :) gl with your install linux isn't for everyone
[15:19] <NoImNotNineVolt> each network documents its own list of servers. once you're connected, you can list channels yourself.
[15:19] <meetunix> if you can give me the instructions
[15:19] <NoImNotNineVolt> for irssi, you might want to install the elist script to list channels.
[15:20] <k1l_> meetunix: the bot send you the instructions to search for channels in the private window
[15:20] <k1l_> meetunix: to join a new channel type "/join #channelname"
[15:20] <ioria> uio,  swap is not ext4, it's just swap ... :√æ
[15:20] <NoImNotNineVolt> uio: i was able to install ubuntu-for-windows in about 5 minutes.
[15:20] <uio> mjayk: "linux isn't for everyone" ah.
[15:20] <Sillypirato> uio you are just trying to do something that usually would be done the other way around
[15:21] <popMaize> what are they trying to do?
[15:21] <uio> Sillypirato: with encryption you mean?
[15:21] <NoImNotNineVolt> but if you had/have a swap partition, you probably weren't installing "linux on a windows machine".
[15:21] <meetunix> okey can you guys give me link to a guide for new in irssi i search the web and the offical but just dont understand
[15:21] <meetunix> well
[15:22] <ioria> uio,  install without encryption , well'do that later
[15:22] <uio> NoImNotNineVolt: interesting.... but not true
[15:22] <NoImNotNineVolt> meetunix: you may be better served by a different irc client that is more user-friendly.
[15:22] <Sillypirato> uio no im talking about the installer and the partitions
[15:22] <NoImNotNineVolt> uio: so you're saying that your windows installation actually has a swap partition and not a swap file?
[15:23] <NoImNotNineVolt> i haven't been keeping up with windows, so that's news to me.
[15:23] <uio> ioria: but it is there now, and I can't seem to remove them - the installer halts
[15:23] <ioria> uio,  maybe is mounted (you should see a lock ), click to unmount
[15:23] <uio> NoImNotNineVolt: or the process has been so unsmooth that the first attempt created the swap partition.
[15:23] <NoImNotNineVolt> uio: ubuntu-for-windows doesn't create a swap partition.
[15:25] <est31> ehh, seems I've managed to get do-release-upgrade to abort
[15:25] <est31> mid process
[15:25] <est31> I don't know what I did wrong
[15:25] <est31> I just wanted to start a shell to fix /etc/sysctl.conf
[15:25] <est31> (the upgrade complained about conflicts)
[15:26] <est31> and then I removed the changes I did so that it applied cleansly
[15:26] <est31> cleanly*
[15:26] <est31> and then I just pressed ctrl+D to exit the shell
[15:26] <est31> but somehow screen then told me that the process was terminated
[15:26] <est31> so, what to do now?
[15:26] <meetunix> guys suggest some user friendly cli clients
[15:27] <est31> Last time I did dpkg-reconfigure --all but the all option was removed I think
[15:27] <mjayk> meetunix: try hexchat
[15:27] <mjayk> meetunix: oops no
[15:27] <meetunix> yeah its not cli
[15:27] <mjayk> meetunix: i missed the cli bit :D irssi is the only one I know sorry
[15:27] <meetunix> i have it already
[15:28] <meetunix> i want cli
[15:28] <Pici> meetunix: irssi or weechat.
[15:29] <est31> man man man
[15:29] <jaythelinuxguy> uio, if the machine has a sticker on it that says that it was designed for Windows, then it's not the fault of Linux that it doesn't work on that machine. If you want to run Linux, research a machine's compatibility before you buy it, or buy a machine from a Linux vendor.
[15:29] <est31> I am happy that I'm not on a rolling release distro
[15:29] <est31> otherwise I'd have this nightmare every time I updated
[15:29] <hacker> can u guys help me out
[15:29] <meetunix> Dohplay: yeah i m on irssi, can you give any link to newbie guide
[15:29] <hacker> cracking idm in linux
[15:30] <ikonia> no
[15:30] <hacker> ?
[15:30] <ikonia> we are not here to help you break things
[15:30] <hacker> why ?
[15:30] <ikonia> that is not the function of this channel
[15:30] <hacker> ohk
[15:30] <hacker> so basically what is this channel for
[15:30] <est31> so lsb release tells me I'm on 16.10 now
[15:30] <mjayk> hacker: ubuntu help
[15:31] <NoImNotNineVolt> idm is not in the ubuntu repos.
[15:31] <hacker> ohk
[15:31] <hacker> i just installed i am new to linux
[15:31] <est31> so what can I use instead of dpkg-reconfigure -a to solve the issue?
[15:33] <OerHeks> est31, that would be the right command to fix your interrupted upgrade
[15:34] <est31> OerHeks, but it got removed: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/debconf/+bug/1463672/comments/2

[15:34] <OerHeks> not sure what you want to 'fix' on your /etc/sysctl.conf
[15:34] <hacker> i am lvng it
[15:35] <est31> OerHeks, basically I had this issue, but its not really what my current problem is about: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1118958#c27
[15:35] <ubottu> Mozilla bug 1118958 in Sync "Sync fails on unitymedia DS-Lite networks" [Normal,Resolved: fixed]
[15:35] <est31> I just want to make sure that my system boots successfully when I reboot it
[15:35] <ikonia> est31: what's the actual problem here ?
[15:35] <est31> and that all packages are in a halfway consistent state
[15:35] <popMaize> so... if I were to install a completely different distro on the Ubuntu m10 where I can actually use the terminal properly... what options do I have?
[15:35] <est31> ikonia, do-release-upgrade aborted and didn't complete
[15:36] <platta> Running ubuntu 14.04 server as a VM, and I increased the size of its hard drive, but ubuntu doesn't see it. I'm not familiar with LVM, but is there a simple way to have it rescan and expand the main partition to include the new space?
[15:36] <maddawg2> yes
[15:36] <maddawg2> you use GParted
[15:36] <maddawg2> to increase the partition size
[15:36] <ikonia> est31: ok - what point did it fail and why
[15:36] <ikonia> platta: no
[15:36] <maddawg2> ikonia, thats not true
[15:36] <maddawg2> there is an easy way
[15:37] <ikonia> platta: a.) are you using lvm b.) did you increase the physical disk or the logical disk
[15:37] <maddawg2> you just use gparted
[15:37] <platta> maddawg2, I don't have X, so I can't use gparted though.
[15:37] <ikonia> maddawg2: no you don't, that won't extend a file system, a pv or an lv
[15:37] <maddawg2> that extends the parititon
[15:37] <maddawg2> if you boot from Gparted
[15:37] <ikonia> maddawg2: it will not force a rescan
[15:37] <maddawg2> i do it all the time
[15:37] <maddawg2> ummm what?
[15:37] <maddawg2> i increase my disk space all the time with gparted
[15:38] <ikonia> maddawg2: how will that help him with lvm
=== lethu_ is now known as lethu
[15:38] <maddawg2> he boots from gparted and increases the partition
[15:38] <platta> ikonia, Yes, I'm using LVM. I increased the physical disk size.
[15:38] <maddawg2> he added space to his VM
[15:38] <ikonia> maddawg2: how will that help with him lvm
=== cigumo_ is now known as cigumo
[15:38] <NoImNotNineVolt> can't you just unmount the partition? why boot to gparted?
[15:38] <maddawg2> i didnt know hw was using LVM
[15:38] <maddawg2> he said he didn't know much about LVM
[15:38] <ikonia> maddawg2: right - so read what he said
[15:38] <maddawg2> yes he said he didnt know much about it hence why i thought he didnt use it
[15:38] <NoImNotNineVolt> unmount, resize, mount. done.
[15:39] <ikonia> platta: is the physical volume in use
[15:39] <aruns> Hi.
[15:39] <est31> ikonia, basically it ran fine, until it found out that I changed /etc/sysctl.conf, and the new package version has changed it as well. Then I opted it to give me a shell to fix the problem. I edited /etc/sysctl.conf to remove my changes, and pressed ctrl+d to exit the shell. Then screen told me that the process has terminated (do-release-upgrade always starts screen).
[15:39] <aruns> Does anyone know what the PPA for the latest release of Emacs is?
[15:40] <smclt30p> Does anyone have a SanDisk ssd here?
[15:40] <ikonia> est31: so basically you interupted it
[15:40] <aruns> Running a search using 'emacs' as search term on Launchpad, but showing hundreds of matches.
[15:40] <ikonia> est31: and you want it to conntinue
[15:40] <est31> yes
[15:40] <est31> doing do-release upgrade again doesnt work
[15:40] <est31> that was my first try
[15:40] <platta> ikonia, Yes, it's the only physical disk attached to the machine.
[15:40] <est31> thing I tried*
[15:40] <ikonia> est31: define doesn't work
[15:40] <rory> aruns: there is no official (emacs project) PPA for emacs
[15:40] <arbitrarystring> try the gui tool system-config-lvm
[15:40] <est31> ikonia, # do-release-upgrade
[15:40] <est31> Checking for a new Ubuntu release
[15:40] <est31> No new release found
[15:41] <ikonia> platta: have you actually made any change
[15:41] <rory> aruns: This one is popular for nightly builds https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa
[15:41] <aruns> rory: Ah OK, thanks, so I just have to install the default version of Emacs for Ubuntu then?
[15:41] <rory> aruns: yeah it'll be fine honestly, I bet it's the latest stable version anyway
[15:41] <aruns> rory: Oh, this is for the development builds of Emacs?
=== sins-_y is now known as sins-
[15:41] <aruns> The link you should sent me.
[15:41] <rory> aruns: for automated nightly builds I think
[15:41] <aruns> rory: Ah OK, thanks.
[15:41] <ikonia> est31: so why do you think it's not upgraded all the packages ?
[15:42] <aruns> rory: So they might not necessarily be tested / debugged?
[15:42] <rory> they absolutely aren't
[15:42] <platta> ikonia, Yes, I powered off the VM and increased the size of the physical disk (this is in Oracle VirtualBox). VirtualBox shows new size correctly.
[15:42] <hacker> what is vidalia ?
[15:42] <rory> aruns: you want to just install emacs from the ubuntu repository, I guarentee it.
[15:42] <hacker> this tor network thing is not working properly
[15:42] <popMaize> are there other distros I can install on an arm tablet and expect it to work? ubuntu touch is feeling less ready every time I use it
[15:43] <OerHeks> hacker, Vidalia is a discontinued cross-platform GUI for ... dead project
[15:43] <k1l> hacker: report to tor then
[15:43] <ikonia> platta: ok, so you need to do a pvresze, then your VG will show the increase
[15:43] <rory> popMaize: there are other distros but this is for Ubuntu support - try ##linux
[15:43] <OerHeks> hacker, tor is leaking anyway.
[15:43] <hacker> whats new project ?
[15:43] <ikonia> hacker: what is the ubuntu problem you need help with ?
[15:43] <k1l> popMaize: you can install a ubuntu desktop with some manual work on most tablets. for other linux distributions better ask ##linux
[15:44] <est31> ikonia, because it exited right after I edited the file. It didnt configure any other packages
[15:44] <ikonia> est31: are your sources now pointing at 16.10 repos ?
[15:44] <est31> ikonia, also, I'm scared of attempting a reboot
[15:44] <popMaize> thanks, will try there. Started as an ubuntu tablet though, so thought it might have good luck here
[15:44] <est31> because I don't know how inconsistent the state my system is in right now
[15:45] <ikonia> est31: has the upgrade changed your sources to point at 16.10 ?
[15:45] <OerHeks> est31, make a fresh iso on usb, before trying to reboot
[15:45] <est31> ikonia, yes
[15:45] <ikonia> est31: so if you do an apt-get upgrade and then dist-upgrade it should attempt to update any packages that are not "current"
[15:45] <ikonia> that will show you the current state of the system
[15:46] <est31> ikonia, that complains about not getting the apt lock
[15:46] <est31> should I delete the lock file?
[15:46] <est31> ps -A -l | grep apt is empty
[15:46] <ikonia> est31: yeah
[15:46] <est31> apt update tells me to do dpkg --configure -a
[15:47] <est31> doing that now
[15:47] <est31> is that the replacement of dpkg-reconfigure??
[15:47] <est31> cool
[15:51] <aruns> rory: Eww, the GUI version of Emacs looks terrible.
[15:51] <speaker1234> I need to give user access to a GUI desktop over a VPN link. I've tried to use the built-in VNC but it seems to require you to be logged in before you have access to machine. Also, the built-in VNC gives me "server did not offer supported security type error".
[15:52] <speaker1234> What is the current best practice for providing remote desktop access from 16.04
[15:53] <Braven> hello Everyone
[15:54] <est31> ooohkay
[15:54] <est31> it looks really good
[15:54] <est31> now I have to reboot
[15:54] <aruns> speaker1234: Do they need access to the GUI? Would shell access not suffice?
=== est is now known as est31
[15:54] <rory> aruns: I can't help you with that :D
[15:55] <aruns> rory: Unfortunately, the console version doesn't look much nicer either xD
[15:55] <rory> aruns: use vim then
[15:55] <aruns> rory: I use that, just haven't used Emacs before so wanted to try it out.
[15:55] <rory> aruns: you're not missing much. IMO it doens't matter which you learn as long as you learn one :D
[15:56] <aruns> rory: Yeah, well, I started off with Nano but have slowly progressed onto Vim and am finding it much more useful. But I think that other than Nano, Vi, Vim and Emacs, there aren't any other console text editors for Linux, are there?
[15:56] <aruns> Or am I wrong?
[15:56] <rory> there is ed, the standard editor
[15:57] <Braven> what is the command to update DNS for an interface
[15:57] <est31> you can use butterflies
[15:57] <est31> :)
[15:57] <est31> aand it worked!
[15:57] <est31> yaay!
[15:58]  * est31 now is on a working ubuntu 16.10
[16:00] <aruns> rory: Sweet, am learning that now, thanks. I know there's also the Pico and Jed command line editors, are they any good?
=== AnansiDeSpin is now known as marshal0505
[16:01] <arbitrarystring> aruns: pico was the old version of nano essentially
[16:02] <SchrodingersScat> pico is now an alias for nano in ubuntu
[16:03] <jaythelinuxguy> lol I never knew that, in regards to pico
[16:04] <smclt30p> Does anyone have a Samsung 8X0 Series SSD?
[16:04] <smclt30p> 850 Pro/Evo, 840 Pro/Evo
[16:04] <arbitrarystring> pico was the editor developed by the university of washington, and it changed to nano when it got open sourced
=== Luke_ is now known as Guest23565
[16:06] <est31> smclt30p, yes, why?
[16:07] <smclt30p> I need some information. @est31 Can you run a hdparm -I on the SSD or provide /sys/block/XXX/device/model and /sys/block/XXX/device/vendor
[16:07] <smclt30p> and send the data via a paste?
[16:08] <kamisama> #oslohackerspace
[16:08] <est31> smclt30p, model is "Samsung SSD 850" and vendor is "ATA"
[16:09] <est31> I wont provide you with the hdparm -I output
[16:09] <cmyrland> O hai. After installing elementaryOS, grub does not display my ubuntu install. Ubuntu is installed on sda with btrfs, elementary on sdb with ext4, grub is installed on sda. I've tried googling, but found to apparent solution..
[16:09] <smclt30p> @est32 Thanks. Why not?
[16:09] <est31> smclt30p, what exactly do you need it for anyway
[16:09] <Keydns> is there some sort of data manipulation simulation terminal software
[16:11] <est31> Keydns, you mean things like awk or sed? or more something like julia cli?
[16:11] <est31> also python has a REPL for the terminal
[16:11] <smclt30p> I'm developing a program for disk information and diagnostics, and there is a pretty logo on it, along with a model. I need to guess the manufacturer based on the model and vendor file (you provided). See -> https://imgur.com/a/mVs0o
[16:12] <est31> I see
[16:13] <est31> this looks like KDE
[16:13] <est31> nice
=== for{} is now known as audio_heroin
=== est is now known as est31
[16:16] <smclt30p> @est32 It is KDE. It's not even Ubuntu, its Arch.
[16:18] <MonkeyDust> smclt30p  arch support in #archlinux ... you have to !register
[16:19] <speaker1234> aruns: (sorry, phone distraction) Yes they really do need the GUI. They are only doing simple things (adding/deleting users) and the added complexity/culture shock of the shell just won't fly for this company.
[16:19] <smclt30p> @MonkeyDust I did not ask for Arch support. Or any kind of support. I was interested in hardware.
[16:19] <nacc> smclt30p: i don't think the ubuntu support channel is the appropriate place to ask users for their hardware info
[16:20] <smclt30p> @nacc I asked in a lot of channels to reach a lot of people
[16:20] <est31> smclt30p, http://paste.ubuntu.com/23344530/
=== nicomach1s is now known as nicomachus
[16:20] <est31> I've XX ed out the serial numbers
[16:20] <nacc> smclt30p: that doesn't make it appropriate..
[16:22] <smclt30p> @est32 See, that makes it a lot more interesting, as hdparm issues a ATA IDENTIFY command, asking the drive to show its ID. There, you can see its a lot more detailed, like the Model field. Now i know If it is a Pro or Evo drive.
[16:23] <cmyrland> so.. any idea how to fix the grub/ubuntu btrfs issue?
[16:24] <smclt30p> @cmyrland Did you install os-prober?
[16:24] <smclt30p> Install os-prober and run grub-update as root
[16:25] <cmyrland> @smclt30p: already installed, no go
[16:26] <Ivana> Hey
[16:26] <Ivana> can someone help me fix something
[16:26] <Ivana> i have a brand new fresh copy of ubuntu

[16:26] <Ivana> but i can move the mouse around and click on stuff but its invisible
[16:26] <Ivana> but the mouse pointer icon stays in the same place
[16:27] <smclt30p> @Ivana caoo @cmyrland What is your disk <-> OS conf?
[16:27] <Ivana> the mouse works though
[16:27] <Ivana> ubuntu 16.10
[16:27] <Ivana> disk?

[16:29] <cmyrland> @smclt30p: what do you mean, disk <-> OS conf? sda (ssd drive) has ubuntu on btrfs, sdb has elementary on ext4..
[16:29] <smclt30p> I asked you that. @Ivana bootstrap a system via a command line and install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers.

[16:30] <arbitrarystring> Ivana: www.webupd8.org/2016/06/how-to-install-latest-nvidia-drivers-in.html
[16:30] <arbitrarystring> it worked for me
[16:30] <davido_> I have a bluetooth mouse. Today I showed up at work and the mouse was no longer functioning.  Inside the System Settings | Bluetooth CP, I see "No Bluetooth adapters found"
[16:31] <davido_> (fortunately the mouse has a non-bluetooth dongle mode too)
[16:31] <root____3> help
[16:31] <Ivana> @smclt30p do you think the mouse pointer issue is related to the graphics card?
[16:31] <root____3> logout
[16:32] <cmyrland> @smclt30p, okay ;) I wrote that earlier, but accidentially quit the webirc client because of elementary's doofus placement of tab close button..
[16:32] <smclt30p> @Ivana you can check that. Reboot the install and disable KMS, and then boot the install again without KMS
[16:32] <smclt30p> @Ivana you can do that by adding nomodeset to the kernel parameters
[16:32] <nacc> smclt30p: you don't need to use @ and most clients don't recognize it for IRC
[16:32] <davido_> The bluetooth adapter is built-into my laptop. It simply ceased to be found by Ubuntu (16.04, 4.4.0-43-generic)
[16:33] <smclt30p> nacc: Bad habit
[16:33] <ouroumov_> davido_, do you get your mouse back when you try an older kernel?
[16:33] <davido_> I haven't shifted back to an older kernel.
[16:34] <smclt30p> Ivana: Reboot the Ubuntu install disk, on the screen with the little man in the bottom press Tab, then press F6, Escape, and add nomodeset to the line, then press enter
[16:34] <ouroumov_> davido_, can you try? Do you know how to?
[16:34] <MonkeyDust> davido_  install blueman
[16:34] <Ivana> ill try in a few :)
[16:34] <cmyrland> davido_: I guess you've checked for physical switches being turned off?
[16:36] <coconut16> hi! have you got any problems with cron and script which output in a text file?
[16:36] <coconut16> my script only write the output when I run it manually but not at cron
[16:37] <coconut16> hi! have you got any problems with cron and script which output in a text file? I don't find a solution for my problem but it seems the solution for others

[16:42] <vite> Howdy, I installed Ubuntu alongside an existing win10. Is there a way I can extract the win10 installation with it's existing config, and create a virtual machine and just vanilla install ubuntu and make ubuntu host win10?
[16:42] <est31> vite, I think so
[16:43] <Ivana> smclt30p it worked :D
[16:43] <Ivana> i installed the other driver and mouse moves again
[16:43] <smclt30p> @Ivana you mean you did nomodeset?
[16:43] <smclt30p> Or installed the proprietary Nvidia driver?
[16:43] <est31> vite, maybe you want to try this: http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#rawdisk
[16:43] <Ivana> nah i never had the right driver
[16:44] <Ivana> this is what i was looking at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[16:44] <MonkeyDust> vite  explore ACEtoneISO, find it in the ubuntu repos
[16:45] <micros> does anyone know how to post a user key event for KEY_VOLDOWN/UP where the input type is EV_REL?  when i do this, no event is processed under android.  If i use EV_KEY, it works OK, but this is not suitable for a rotary knob which provides only a relative offset when its turned.
[16:45] <vite> thanks I'll look into it
[16:45] <MonkeyDust> micros  how is that ubuntu related?

[16:46] <micros> maybe keyboard input driver
[16:46] <micros> rotary volume knob
[16:46] <gamester> Sometimes when I search for an application it doesn't find it, then I try again and it might find it. Why doesn't such a simple operation simply work? (16.04)
[16:46] <MonkeyDust> micros  are you in ubuntu now?
[16:46] <micros> can you please suggest alternative channels?
[16:46] <nacc> gamester: how are you searching?
[16:46] <MonkeyDust> micros  type   /msg alis list blah
[16:46] <gamester> nacc: by clicking on the keyboard's windows button and typing the application name
[16:47] <nacc> gamester: ok, i've not experienced that issue, sorry
[16:48] <gamester> np. It actually stops searching before it finds it. Yet a second later I can try again and it might find it. If not, I just keep repeating till it does.
[16:48] <gamester> Happens once a week
[16:48] <gamester> For any application, like Skype
[16:50] <davido_> sorry for the belated reply.  Yes, I've checked the switch. This LT has a single switch that turns off all radios. Given that wifi still works, I think we're ok on that.  As for rolling kernel versions back, I probably could do that, though getting pegged to an older version is less desirable in the longrun.
[16:51] <davido_> blueman is installed.
[16:51] <vite> has anyone noticed google chrome sorta freeze on the new ubuntu. you have to hit refresh for it to work at times.

[17:02] <brunch875> am I the only one whose singnonpluginprocess segfaults often?
[17:02] <compdoc> maybe
[17:04] <MonkeyDust> brunch875  that's a yes/no question, start from the beginning, what are you doing or trying
[17:06] <wtfman> i'm using the gnome disk editor to format a flash drive with LUKS encryption. i can unencrypt the partition fine on the machine i formatted the drive with, but on every other ubuntu machine (all running 16.04) i get "this location could not be displayed. you do not have the permissions necessary..." despite entering the correct passprase. what's going on?
[17:06] <wtfman> i created a LUKS partition on my laptop, unreadable on my desktop. and vice versa.
[17:07] <wtfman> so it's not the machine that's the issue
[17:07] <brunch875> MonkeyDust: I'm not really doing anything special. But that program is crashing often by itself
[17:07] <ioria> wtfman, ecryptfs-utils cryptsetup are installed on the other machines ?
[17:07] <brunch875> was just wondering if I was the only one affected
[17:08] <wtfman> ioria: ecryptfs-utils wasn't
[17:08] <wtfman> set
[17:08] <wtfman> sec*
[17:09] <wtfman> installed it, still not working
[17:09] <ioria> wtfman,  try a reboot
[17:10] <wtfman> ioria: no dice
[17:11] <wtfman> just rebooted
[17:11] <ioria> wtfman,  are we talking about a usb pen , right ?
[17:12] <wtfman> ioria: yep
[17:12] <wtfman> i formatted it with LUKS encryption on two different 16.04 machines. each one can decrypt it, but only if it formatted it.
[17:12] <wtfman> if that makes sense
[17:13] <speaker1234> ok, x2go fails for 16.04 stock. Any other suggestions for how to give GUI remote access? built in VNC has failed because I can't find a client that works (security/authentication modes not supported)
[17:13] <ioria> wtfman,  and when you plug it, nautilus is giving you that message ?
[17:13] <wtfman> first it prompts for the passphrase
[17:13] <wtfman> but yeah, ioria. soon as i put the passphrase in.
[17:14] <ioria> wtfman,  dmesg | tail says nothing ?
[17:15] <compdoc> x2goserver works on 16.04
[17:15] <wtfman> ioria: [   29.507375] EXT4-fs (dm-3): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
[17:15] <speaker1234> compdoc: All I get is a black screen. Nothing in unity shows up
[17:16] <wtfman> ioria: file explorer shows the "unlocked" icon next to the drive too
[17:16] <ocx32> hello
[17:16] <wtfman> but i just can't view the contents
[17:16] <wtfman> ioria: i googled and can't find anybody else with this problem really either.
[17:16] <ocx32> i booted in gparted livecd to extand /boot , so i shrinked / few mbs and extanded /boot, pressed apply and now i am unable to boot my ubuntu
[17:17] <ioria> wtfman,  i see.... what's on the flash drives ? generally, i mean
[17:17] <wtfman> pdf docs and such
[17:17] <wtfman> ioria: it's a 32GB drive, i'm only using 1GB of it
[17:18] <compdoc> speaker1234, no remote client works with Unity. Needs to be a '2D' desktop.  There is a client that might work - but cant think the name. trying to find it
[17:19] <compdoc> LogMeIn
[17:19] <ioria> wtfman,  ls /media/<user>/   ?
[17:19] <speaker1234> compdoc: I'm thinking it's time to just punt and go to teamviewer
[17:19] <pjp> Hi, I created a new Ubuntu 16.04 guest using virt-builder. When I #virsh start guest, it does not open the console even ssh login isn't working. Any idea how to enable console?
[17:19] <dxiri> Hi everyone, looking for some help on setting up a bridge for use with openstack
[17:20] <compdoc> speaker1234, yeah, that one. What I do is install Ubuntu Server with a minimal Mate desktop, and then use x2goserver
[17:20] <wtfman> ioria: huh?
[17:20] <dxiri> I'm using this config for the interfaces: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/openstack-ansible/install-guide/app-config-test.html#test-environment-config
[17:20] <ocx32> anyone?
[17:20] <wtfman> ioria: it's listed in there
[17:20] <ioria> wtfman,  check in  /media/<user>/<device>  if mounted
[17:20] <wtfman> ya it is
[17:20] <wtfman> it's mounted in there
[17:20] <dxiri> everything looks fine but I can't seem to be able to ping the bridge interface from the outside
[17:21] <dxiri> any clues?
[17:21] <ioria> wtfman,  can you cd in there ?
[17:21] <speaker1234> compdoc:  Unfortunately, in this context, that's not a solution for this particular user. They use the desktop rarely and they know unity so, unity is what they want. No, they don't want to switch, and to try and force a switch on a user is a major fail
[17:21] <wtfman> ioria: Permission denied
[17:21] <wtfman> when i try to cd
[17:21] <ioria> wtfman,   ls -l /path/to/usb
[17:22] <ioria> wtfman,   check the owner
[17:22] <compdoc> speaker1234, time to switch users. jk :)
[17:22] <wtfman> ioria: ls: cannot open directory
[17:22] <ioria> wtfman,   ls -l /media/<user>
[17:23] <speaker1234> compdoc: :-) Yeah that comes back to blaming the user. Not really a good approach.
[17:23] <ioria> wtfman,   also   ls -ld  /media/<user>
[17:23] <wtfman> ioria: drwx------ 4 999 999 4096 Oct 18 13:01

[17:23] <wtfman> it's owned by root?
[17:23] <wtfman> ...
[17:23] <naruto_> how to updata ubuntu mate ?
[17:24] <MonkeyDust> naruto_  sudo apt updtae && sudo apt upgrade
[17:24] <speaker1234> compdoc: I think if there was some way I could get them the unity control panel via X11, it would be okay
[17:24] <wtfman> ioria: is it somehow owned by root?
[17:24] <ioria> wtfman,   no
[17:24] <coconut16> anyone program shell script?
[17:25] <wtfman> ioria: i just put the wrong passphrase in to test it and when i do that it doesn't even mount
[17:25] <wtfman> so i'm def using the correct passphrase
[17:25] <nacc> coconut16: many people do, you probably want #bash
[17:25] <ioria> wtfman,   that's normal
[17:26] <coconut16> thanks!
[17:26] <wtfman> i mean, this makes LUKS 100% unusable for me. encryption is useless if it results in data loss.
[17:26] <wtfman> this is horrible =[
[17:26] <ioria> wtfman,   i think you have to chown the folder ...
[17:26] <ioria> wtfman,   can you paste ls -Rld /home/<user>
[17:27] <wtfman> ioria: drwxr-xr-x 22 blake blake 4096 Oct 18 13:10 /home/blake
[17:27] <GrayCS> Hello
[17:28] <ocx32> anyone?
[17:28] <ioria> wtfman,   can you paste ls -Rld /home/<user> /<device>
[17:28] <wtfman> ioria: what is /<device>
[17:28] <wtfman> oh sec
[17:28] <wtfman> ioria: wait, what do you want for /<device>
[17:28] <bhearsum> hi there, does anyone know how to get unity-control-center to show all icons in non-unity display managers? in 16.04, setting XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP would do it, but that doesn't work in 16.10...at least not with i3
[17:28] <nacc> ocx32: you changed an actual fileystems size on disk?
[17:29] <ocx32> nacc: yes
[17:29] <wtfman> drwxr-xr-x 22 blake blake 4096 Oct 18 13:10 /home/blake
[17:29] <ioria> wtfman,   sorry i meant   ls -Rld /media/<user>/<device>
[17:29] <nacc> ocx32: i don't think that's generally a safe thing to do
[17:30] <nacc> ocx32: why did you do that?
[17:30] <wtfman> ls -Rld /media/blake/Blake's Flash Dr/
[17:30] <ocx32> nacc: there is like 1TB of free space
[17:30] <ocx32> nacc: coz /boot is 100MB only
[17:30] <ocx32> and i need to expand it
[17:30] <wtfman> ioria: drwx------ 4 999 999 4096 Oct 18 13:01 /media/blake/Blake's Flash Dr/
[17:30] <ocx32> so i removed free space from / and added to /boot
[17:31] <OerHeks> bhearsum, unity control center for i3?  i think you need to write one yourself
[17:31] <ioria> wtfman,   sudo chown  blake:blake "/media/blake/Blake's Flash Dr/"
[17:31] <nacc> ocx32: you might have needed to reinstall grub after that?
[17:32] <ocx32> nacc: it is not installing
[17:32] <bhearsum> OerHeks: should i be using gnome-control-center and gnome-settings-daemon instead? i've been using the unity versions for years with i33...
[17:32] <ocx32> i did chroot mnt after mounting
[17:32] <ocx32> and it gives me an error: canot find a deivice /boot/grub
[17:32] <wtfman> ioria: worked!
[17:32] <nacc> ocx32: what does `grub-install` say?
[17:32] <wtfman> wtf caused that, ioria?
[17:32] <nacc> ocx32: how are you invoking it?
[17:32] <wtfman> i'm still confused what the issue was
[17:32] <wtfman> so, i used the name username (blake) on both my desktop and laptop
[17:32] <wtfman> and i formatted the drive as blake on my desktop
[17:33] <ioria> wtfman,   no clue really, but good job !
[17:33] <OerHeks> bhearsum, i3 is not my cup of tea, gnome-control center is not the suitable tool either for i3

[18:17] <diskord> hi
[18:17] <diskord> Could i install nvidia driver without xorg?
[18:20] <tomreyn> diskord: the X server will work without the nvidia driver, but not the other way around.
[18:20] <OerHeks> diskord, what is your goal? w3hat x server are you using then?
[18:20] <diskord> it's for my friend
[18:20] <diskord> he want to use cuda without xserver
[18:21] <diskord> for machine learning
[18:21] <ppf> diskord: the problem is not installing the driver but loading it
[18:21] <ppf> the xserver would normally do that
[18:21] <ppf> with out x you need to do it
[18:22] <ppf> there's nvidia-modprobe or persistenced that can do this
[18:24] <diskord> is it possible to install cuda on it?

[18:51] <bencc> ppf: and that you should leave some spare cpu cycles for safty. or maybe I'm not looking at the right metric?
[18:51] <aruns> enma_: You can use the 'shutdown' command on terminal
[18:51] <OerHeks> bencc, it can be 4.0 with a 4-core

[18:52] <ppf> bencc: you don't need 'cpu cycles for safety'
[18:53] <HexicPyth> Hi this is probably an odd question, but I have been reccommended to go here from #aircrack. I'm trying to get my HP Probook 6455b's Broadcom BC4313 to work under aircrack, but for whatever reason, blacklisting "wl" and forcing b43 to load cuts off wireless all together. It worked fine in kali, I just wanted to be able to have a more general-purpose OS for the sake of not rebooting all the time. Any ideas?
[18:53] <bencc> ppf: I'm transcoding live streams. if a transcoding task doesn't have enough cpu power it will drop frames
[18:53] <ppf> enma_: if you hit escape it'll tell you what's up
[18:53] <bencc> ppf: I'm looking for the metric to tell me I'm putting too much load on the server
[18:53] <aruns> lardfish: Not sure, http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/8690/what-is-the-difference-between-halt-and-shutdown-commands might answer your question
[18:53] <HexicPyth> *BCM4313
[18:53] <aruns> lardfish: But it seems as though that it invokes the shutdown command automatically if it has not already begun the shutdown process
[18:53] <aruns> But I haven't tested this.

[18:56] <ppf> sonic__: you're in the right place, just stick around
[18:56] <bencc> OerHeks: all I'm asking is if id=0 means the cpu is 100% busy
[18:56] <ppf> yes
[18:56] <sonic__> ppf: thanks
[18:56] <ppf> bencc: that's what it means
[18:56] <Spacy> bencc: load 1.0 means exactly one task is waiting to get CPU time.. in top, you also see "us" time.. That actually is in percent of the total cpu.

[19:02] <sonic__> It's been a little while since I used IRC. I had a pretty sweet inspircd server going, basically to spite my ex wife. I caught her cheating online on a, "harm reduction drug forum" well with someone from there, she was using pidgin
[19:02] <Spacy> bencc: yes.. for the "averages" you will see 3 figures.. the 5min, the 10min and the 15min average. As said, it is pretty much the average of how much CPU is used.. from 0 = nothing to (lets say) 8.0 on a 8 core cpu. Note that this relates to so-called hyperthreads, so an I7 with 4 cores would have 8 threads and as such a load maximum of 8.0
[19:02] <sonic__> anyway, I setup everything for her on freenode, made her channel owner, then I couldn't find the file I saved with her password, she managed to have it and took away my ops
[19:03] <sonic__> so I bought a VPS, gave everyone oper status, basically created a small communist government where people could play. People loved it. It caused the guy who helped her get my ops taken away to put a bunch of bots in the channel. I showed her, lulz. Since then I haven't used IRC

[19:16] <younder> Still using a compiler that came out in 1990, which is 26 yeas ago is a bit odd. At the time though it was state of the art.
[19:16] <ppf> Noidea_: if your teacher requires you to develop in turbo c++ you should _really_ drop that course
=== insightgh is now known as kegan_
[19:16] <OerHeks> AlexQ, with the old-release trick, yes, but it will take hours

[19:21] <ppf> i was afraid you had a teacher giving you assignments in turbo c++ :)

My question is i guess... Is dualboot still a thing? I love Ubuntu, but I need to keep windows as well, for university things and some games etc. any advice?
[19:27] <AlexQ> OerHeks: What if I created an ext4 partition and extracted the ISO contents there, did reboot back into 15.04, and then run update-grub (maybe it would find the kernel on that extracted live image) and then rebooted into the live version?
[19:27] <ronaldsmazitis> ppf: why
[19:27] <Spacy> Nelson_, : Do you need the zip format? Or could it be any compressed format?
[19:27] <ppf> what do you mean, 'why'
[19:27] <ronaldsmazitis> I don't use ssh
[19:27] <Noidea_> I used ubuntu in my raspberry pi and windows in my pc
[19:28] <ppf> ronaldsmazitis: ubuntu still runs it by default
[19:28] <ronaldsmazitis> how can I disable ssh-agent
[19:28] <Nelson_> ppf I mean, I've got a folder with files and subfolders inside. I want to write down the structure in a zip file so that I would be able to recreate it later. I don't need to acually archive anything e.g. the zip should be very small in size
[19:28] <ppf> why do you want to
[19:28] <Noidea_> use*
[19:28] <ronaldsmazitis> ppf: because I don't use ssh
[19:28] <AlexQ> NinjaWilsy: AFAIK it is still at thing, fortunately :)
[19:28] <OerHeks> AlexQ, i don't know about that
[19:28] <kegan_> can someone recommend a good stack for ubuntu
[19:28] <kegan_> or should i have just installed another distro
[19:28] <younder> Noidea_, Isnt 1 Gb a bit slim fr ubuntu?
[19:28] <OerHeks> kegan_, good stack ?
[19:28] <Bray90820> So can someone help me ubuntu 16.0 on my surface 3 freezes every time I use a web browser and i think it might be a graphics driver issue
[19:28] <Bray90820> http://pastebin.com/raw/1eE6xJBH
[19:28] <kegan_> server stack
[19:28] <Nelson_> Spacy I was expecting zip format would support this but I guess other formats are ok
[19:28] <kegan_> secure and lightweight
[19:28] <ppf> ronaldsmazitis: yes but why do you need to disable ssh-agent
[19:28] <kegan_> php/apache at least
[19:28] <ppf> i just don't get it
[19:29] <ronaldsmazitis> it takes ram
[19:29] <OerHeks> kegan_, ubuntu is fine, join #ubuntu-server perhaps?
[19:29] <Noidea_> ppf : I need some instructions to work in codeblocks, come in!
[19:29] <kegan_> thanks OerHeks  :)
[19:29] <meetunix> NinjaWilsy: yes you can but firt look at this "http://www.howtogeek.com/175649/what-you-need-to-know-about-using-uefi-instead-of-the-bios/"
[19:29] <ronaldsmazitis> and it's unusual to run applications that You don't use
[19:29] <ppf> Noidea_: you should google a codeblocks introductory tutorial
[19:29] <NinjaWilsy> AlexQ: That's great, cause I overheard a lecturer saying that dualbooting was a bit outdated and not used or something. But I shouldn't really run into any trouble with a 2Tb harddrive in terms of space anyway. can you change the amount of space you dedicate to Ubuntu after install?
[19:30] <younder> UEFI caused problems with the NVIDIA driver on 16.04. I had to turn off kernel module checking to make it work
[19:30] <OerHeks> Noidea_, read some manual first? www.codeblocks.org/user-manual
[19:30] <Noidea_> ppf: pi youtube is slow
[19:30] <NinjaWilsy> meetunix: thanks :)
[19:30] <Spacy> Nelson_: tar is usually the util to use... tar-cJf foo folder <- c=create, J=use XC to compress (-z = zlib, -j=bzip2) and -f= write the archive to this file... last argument = folder to archive
[19:30] <Noidea_> oh ok oeerheks
[19:30] <AlexQ> NinjaWilsy: You can do it during install. But of course you're strongly advised to backup all your important data from your laptop before installing Ubuntu
[19:30] <AlexQ> NinjaWilsy: Especially as you have no recent experience
[19:30] <diffis> Hello. Does anyone have an idea (or web page that shows) how the support times for Ubuntu + vanilla XFCE and Xubuntu differs? Assuming LTS versions. I know Xubuntu should be supported 3 years and pure Ubuntu 5 years, but the thing I don't understand is how the vanilla xfce package affects to this.
[19:30] <ppf> ronaldsmazitis: how much ram does it use
[19:31] <NinjaWilsy> Driver problems? ahh, that's not good for me. I know nothing about drivers
[19:31] <Nelson_> Thanks Spacy will try it
[19:31] <ronaldsmazitis> ppf it seems like it has something to do with gnome keyrings
[19:31] <NinjaWilsy> Backup, still the best advice around :P
[19:31] <ioria> Noidea_ it won't  work if you haven't install a compiler ...
[19:31] <ppf> gnome-keyring runs as ssh-agent by default, yes
[19:31] <ronaldsmazitis> what does keyring do?
[19:31] <ppf> it caches passwords for you
[19:32] <Spacy> Nelson_: 7z is also available in pretty much any linux distro and is quite nice (,though you might need to install it)
[19:32] <Nelson_> ok bye
[19:32] <AlexQ> NinjaWilsy: You can try searching the Web for your particular laptop model and Ubuntu / Linux compatibility
[19:32] <younder> keyring saves you from having to enter the passwords every time you connect
[19:32] <NinjaWilsy> If I knew what that was I could :D
[19:33] <NinjaWilsy> AlexQ: It's a new HP Pavillion?
[19:34] <Noidea_> got GCC ioria:
[19:34] <ioria> Noidea_  and g++ ?
[19:35] <Noidea_> it says it detected a compiled named gcc
[19:35] <Noidea_> but file is not getting built
[19:35] <ioria> Noidea_  dpkg -l  build-essential
[19:37] <Noidea_> built essential is installed
[19:37] <Noidea_> already installed*
[19:37] <ioria> Noidea_   it's ok, then
[19:38] <ioria> Noidea_    you should have the build log at bottom
[19:38] <stevo_> Noidea_ gcc --version
[19:38] <Noidea_> its not getting save , so its not getting built, why isn't the file getting saved?
[19:38] <stevo_> in terminal
[19:39] <NinjaWilsy> meetunix: that link didn't work, 404 error
[19:39] <Noidea_> stuck on checking existence
[19:39] <ioria> Noidea_    first try it... new file,  .c extension --- the classic Helloworld, compile, build and execute
[19:40] <OerHeks> he better seeks help in ##c or ##c++ or ##programming
[19:40] <Noidea_> 5.3.1 20160413
[19:40] <ioria> he's right
[19:42] <ppf> Noidea_: use ##c++-general over ##c++
[19:42] <TheFatherMind> Greetings!
[19:42] <TheFatherMind> Question: When upgrading ubuntu it removed all my 3rd party programs. How do I stop that from happening?
[19:43] <TheFatherMind> For example I had installed a deb for plex.  And it removed it.
[19:43] <OerHeks> TheFatherMind, not.  add them again after upgrade.
[19:43] <TheFatherMind> That is a shitload of work.  It is pretty much like starting over.
[19:43] <OerHeks> TheFatherMind, upgrading process cannot include all sorts of 3rd party stuff.
[19:43] <TheFatherMind> There has to be a way to tell the upgrade process not to do that.
[19:44] <TheFatherMind> I do not want it to include it.  I want it not to remove it.
[19:49] <ioria> TheFatherMind, how did you install them ? sudo dpkg -i   .deb ? you can do a script and reinstall them in one shot : dpkg -i *.deb
=== arun_ is now known as Guest30735
=== Guest30735 is now known as xubun2
[19:50] <TheFatherMind> Different things different ways.  some with .deb's like plex.  But I have found after it uninstalls them.. installing them back breaks them often.  I just see no point in removing them in the first place every time I upgrade.  Last time I upgraded a box I spent 1 hour uprgrading and 4 hours trying to get the box back to where it was prior.
[19:51] <TheFatherMind> Surly there has to be a flag I can set to tell it not to do that.
[19:51] <OerHeks> I am sure there is not.
[19:51] <TheFatherMind> Seriously... it would be easier to setup a whole new computer and copy the configs over bit by bit and make sure it all works.  That is not a smooth upgrade process when you feel compelled to do that.
[19:52] <MonkeyDust> TheFatherMind  i guess you want some kind of rolling release
[19:52] <OerHeks> make sure you got the latest versions of you .deb packages anyway
[19:53] <TheFatherMind> IDK what I want.  I know I want to upgrade without rebuilding the whole box afterwards.   I mean seriously.. why uninstall kodi and plex.. what could that possibly serve.
[19:53] <TheFatherMind> kodi is even in the repository.
[19:53] <TheFatherMind> It even took out transmission.  It was a total nightmare.
[19:53] <OerHeks> DId you install kodi from our repos or a PPA?
[19:53] <ppf> because the packages you installed aren't compatible with newer version of the base packages
[19:53] <OerHeks> that would explain it.
[19:54] <TheFatherMind> to the best of my knowledge it was installed from the repository.
[19:54] <ppf> that's why you need to install stuff from the repo, so it'll get upgraded along with everything else
[19:55] <OerHeks> regular Kodi should survive, iirc
[19:56] <MonkeyDust> but I have that too, fresh/new install takes about 15 minutes, but reinstalling all manually installed programs takes 1 or 2 hours
[19:56] <MonkeyDust> and i have a separate /home partition
[19:56] <TheFatherMind> Looking at this box that is a mirror of the last box I upgraded.  I have no added repositories.  Yet the upgrade removed shit tons of programs including kodi on the last box.
[19:57] <bezveze> is 16 lts?
[19:57] <TheFatherMind> Whatever their reason for doing this is.  It is a bad bad bad idea and they need a better solution.  There has to be a switch somewhere I can set to make it not do this to me.
[19:57] <ppf> bezveze: 16.04 is
[19:57] <Pici> bezveze: 16.04 is. 16.10 is not.
[19:57] <TheFatherMind> As it is, it is a security risk because now I do not want to upgrade.
[19:57] <ppf> TheFatherMind: 'they' don't have a reason for this
[19:57] <bezveze> ok
=== xorticagreen is now known as xorticagreen_afk
[19:58] <ioria> TheFatherMind, upgrading from what to what ?
[19:58] <ppf> you've installed packages manually that depend on old versions of the base system
[19:58] <TheFatherMind> Well that makes it worse
[19:58] <TheFatherMind> 14.14.4 to whatever is current.
[19:58] <bezveze> for tablet and phone only listed devices are supported?
[19:58] <ppf> if you upgrade the system, these packages need to go
[19:58] <TheFatherMind> planning on doing a do-release-upgrade
[19:58] <ppf> that's why the upgrade tells you what it will remove
[19:58] <OerHeks> TheFatherMind, mind that the switch to 16.04 involves SystemD
[19:59] <ioria> TheFatherMind, slow down :√æ
[19:59] <OerHeks> so rant away, there is no switch to get things installed
[19:59] <TheFatherMind> I will upgrade those packages also.  removing them is counter productive
[19:59] <OerHeks> c/get/keep
[19:59] <ioria> TheFatherMind, uname -r ?

[20:00] <TheFatherMind> I would have upgraded sooner.. but seriously why would I.. I have to rebuild evertyhing from scratch.
[20:00] <ppf> TheFatherMind: you keep blaming the upgrade
=== cigumo_ is now known as cigumo
[20:00] <ppf> you did something weird, and then the upgrade undid that
[20:01] <TheFatherMind> Yeah... I do.  That is the reason I have not upgraded these boxes.
[20:01] <TheFatherMind> I do not want to have to redo everyting.
[20:01] <TheFatherMind> no ppf I did nothing weird.
[20:01] <ioria> TheFatherMind,  i suggest you to upgrade (simply sudo apt-get update, upgrade, and dist-upgrade) ... and if you don't have particular reasons, don't do do-release-upgrade
[20:01] <TheFatherMind> I installed all apps as they were intended to be installed.
[20:02] <TheFatherMind> I have to do the do-release in order to get to the more current repositories to get the packgaes naturally like kodi etc...
[20:02] <TheFatherMind> I want to keep the system current.
[20:03] <TheFatherMind> But not if each system upgrade is going to cause me to have to reinstall and configure everything.
[20:03] <stevo_> TheFatherMind just make
[20:03] <stevo_> disk image
[20:03] <ioria> TheFatherMind,  you are on 3.13.0-88 .... 10 kernel versions to update
[20:03] <stevo_> and do whatever you want :D
[20:03] <ppf> TheFatherMind: the system can't update your apps
[20:03] <ppf> you have to do that yourself
[20:03] <TheFatherMind> can I do that remotely?  I am upgrading my brothers mediabox and he is no where near me.
[20:03] <ppf> that's the way it is
[20:04] <TheFatherMind> ppf I would love to upgrade the apps.  But I cannot.. because the system removes them when I upgrade it.
[20:04] <NUTsTUN> Hey guys, Iwas wondering is one of you could help me with patching a driver I have
[20:04] <TheFatherMind> I actually keep my apps up to date.  The ones that are not in the repository.
[20:04] <ppf> you keep the apps up to date but not your system?
[20:05] <TheFatherMind> The upgreade process really does not give a crap of they are current or not.  It just removes EVERYTHING
[20:05] <TheFatherMind> Yes ppf because uipgrading the system removes the apps
[20:05] <ppf> i'm talking about package and kernel upgrades, not release upgrade
[20:05] <TheFatherMind> I always do those then the do-release upgrade
[20:06] <kegan_> how can i check the status of updates
[20:06] <kegan_> via terminal
[20:06] <TheFatherMind> Did not bother doing those because I have been putting off the do-release
[20:06] <ppf> you're 10 versions behind on the trusty kernel
[20:06] <kegan_> since the installer has hung
[20:06] <ppf> and 5 versions behind on the release
[20:06] <k1l> kegan_: "sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade"
[20:06] <kegan_> oh ok just go for it
[20:06] <ppf> kegan_: which installer
[20:06] <kegan_> ubuntu software
[20:06] <k1l> TheFatherMind: what "apps" are you talking about?
[20:07] <NUTsTUN> I'm trying to patch a touchpad driver, elan_i2c, to fix an issue where it doesn't work on startup. I am running 4.6.0-040600-generic on Ubuntu 16.04. I have the patch file but I dont know how to use it properly
[20:07] <TheFatherMind> kodi, plex, transmission.. I do not remember what other ones it killed.
[20:07] <kegan_> sys mon shows almost no dl rate
[20:07] <k1l> TheFatherMind: why should the updateprocess kill them if you installed them out of the packagesystem?
[20:08] <ppf> k1l: he didn't
[20:08] <k1l> so what are you talking about then?
[20:08] <TheFatherMind> NO clue.  I get a plex .deb file every month.
[20:08] <TheFatherMind> sometimes more often.
[20:08] <k1l> plex is not in the ubuntu repos. so that cant be an issue
[20:08] <kegan_> dirs locked, so it's working
[20:09] <kegan_> it's just working at the speed of molasses
[20:09] <kegan_> freaking ubuntu software...
[20:09] <TheFatherMind> Transmission I added from a 3rd party repository
[20:09] <ppf> !info transmission trusty

[20:09] <sancho_> hi! how can i restore my default package manager & ppa settings?
[20:09] <OerHeks> there you go ..
[20:09] <TheFatherMind> k1l that IS the issue.  Anything not in the ubuntu repos it removes.  And some stuff IN the repos like kodi.
[20:10] <ppf> !info kodi trusty
[20:10] <ubottu> Package kodi does not exist in trusty
[20:10] <OerHeks> ppf +1
[20:10] <k1l> TheFatherMind: no. it will not remove the stuff
[20:10] <ppf> TheFatherMind: hence 'something weird'
[20:10] <OerHeks> all packages outside our repos, no wonder
[20:10] <TheFatherMind> My bad they do have their own repository ppa:team-xbmc/ppa
[20:10] <NUTsTUN> Can anyone help me?
[20:10] <k1l> TheFatherMind: i really dont understand your technical issue. since you are combining 2 complete different systems.
[20:11] <TheFatherMind> Just checked my  notes.
[20:11] <Hell-Razor> hey fellas. I am trying to get linux-firmware-nonfree installed so my broadcom rt61pci will connect and stay connected. Only issue is I cannot find a ppa to add (or how to)
[20:11] <TheFatherMind> HOw is that weird?  3rd party repos' are by design.
[20:11] <OerHeks> Hell-Razor, no-free is removed due to inproper licensing
[20:11] <younder> trusty? that 12.04 isn't it.. You need to thing about upgrading. LTS ends next april
[20:11] <Noidea_> after installing codeblocks ubuntu is getting some internal problems
[20:11] <sorinello>  Hello. Does anyone have any idea why do I need to crc32 kmod when mounting a 128 GB USB flash drive ? When mounting exactly the same model but the 64 GB variant, this module is not required
[20:12] <k1l> TheFatherMind: so your 3rd party repo is broken? and that wants to remove things? why dont you remove or disable the 3rd party repo then?
[20:12] <OerHeks> younder, trusty = 14.04
[20:12] <TheFatherMind> My issue is I want to upgrade ubuntu and keep it current.  But ubuntu does not want me to have my own software from their repo's so it DELETES THEM
[20:12] <TheFatherMind> the repo works.
[20:12] <k1l> TheFatherMind: that is not correct.

[20:22] <ubottu> Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily Werewolf) was the 23rd release of Ubuntu. Support ended on July 28th, 2016. See !eol, !eolupgrade and http://ubottu.com/y/wily
[20:23] <sancho_> ok ok, i think is better to installa a fresh distro.. i'm using the old ubuntu studio lts but not really using all of its softwares anymore
[20:23] <k1l> sancho_: and the http://ppa.launchpad.net/langdalepl/gvfs-mtp/ubuntu/dists/ ppa doesnt have 14.04 packages at all. you need to remove that ppa.
[20:23] <AndChat425684> K1 yeah I know but I guessing here that the libs used are linked in some way?' nonetheless are there issues to be expected when it.comes to web font rendering and development? If so, solutions?
[20:23] <Bashing-om> sancho_: ^^ what release are you running ? as 15.10 is End_Of_Life .. and also the kernel is out of support .
[20:24] <sancho_> bashing-om: how can i know? i think it's a 14.04
[20:24] <AlexQ> Hi again. It's a old-school BIOS PC. Does the MBR portion of GRUB look for later stages by UUID? I have added one extra partition before the EXT4 partition with GRUB and I am worried that GRUB will stop on stage 1 after I reboot. If I run update-grub before I reboot should it reconfigure GRUB stage 1 to point to the right partition?
[20:25] <k1l> AndChat425684: microsoft does have some patents on font rendering. so until they run out or someone makes a better one, its hard to compare it to free software. but ubuntu uses some good alternatives and other fonts for the system.
[20:25] <Bashing-om> sancho_: K; coukd be 14.04 with outdated HWE . To see the version info : terminal command ' lsb_release -a ' .
[20:25] <OerHeks> AndChat425684, solution? try ubuntu yourself instead of using outdated coloured info
[20:25] <Kinder-Pingvi> Hi. When will be released ubuntu 16.04.2?
[20:25] <Kinder-Pingvi> I did not found any information about it
[20:26] <sancho_> ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS :)
[20:26] <k1l> sancho_: as i said: you need to change to the lts xenial low latency kernel package.
[20:26] <Hell-Razor> OerHeks: I am out of ideas on this one. Is it against the policy here to procide support?
[20:26] <AndChat425684> Oerheks bad advise and rejected I need some answers to questions based upon mybresearch
[20:28] <OerHeks> AndChat425684, now you are trolling, good luck with your 'research'
[20:28] <OerHeks> Hell-Razor, you *can* install the old 1.16 package manually, download the .deb and use dpkg -i <package> but it is unsupported
[20:29] <AndChat425684> Oerheks this also the end of our conversation on this topic
[20:30] <nacc> Kinder-Pingvi: probably not til February if the prior release schedules are followed?
[20:30] <OerHeks> Kinder-Pingvi, i see no date either, should be somewhere this month ? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
[20:30] <AlexQ> OerHeks: Maybe you could tell me if GRUB stage 1 looks for GRUB partition by UUID as well? As I changed my disk layout and the GRUB partition number is different now. Or should I do update-grub or sth before I reboot?
[20:30] <OerHeks> oh, nacc might know more than me
=== programmer is now known as Guest37026
=== Guest37026 is now known as programmer21994
[20:31] <Hell-Razor> OerHeks: I could do that I just dont quite follow the rt61pci issue and why the drivers for it were removed.
[20:31] <OerHeks> AlexQ, yes, update grub would fix layout, not sure the UUID changes ..
[20:31] <nacc> OerHeks: Kinder-Pingvi: i'm basing off of: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases and 14.04.2 and 12.04.2

[20:32] <k1l> #ubuntu-devel might now more details on the release schedule and can ping someone to update the webpage
[20:32] <OerHeks> AlexQ, maybe you need to reinstall grub completely
[20:33] <AlexQ> OerHeks: Yeah, that would be probably the safest option
[20:33] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: http://www.ostechnix.com/configure-grub-2-boot-loader-settings-ubuntu-16-04/
[20:34] <AlexQ> OerHeks: YankDownUnder: Did GParted refresh the partition layout that Kernel knows or sth so I can use the new partition now?
[20:35] <fabienbk> why hello there
[20:35] <AlexQ> Yeah, I have created a new ext4 partition where I am going to install Xubuntu1604LTS. Maybe I should just move GRUB there now.
[20:35] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: Without knowing exactly what yo'uve done with your partition scheme, THAT would be a good thing...logically...
[20:35] <AlexQ> When I install Xubuntu on that partition and do _not_ choose to format that partition, it shouldn't remove the contents of /boot, right?
[20:35] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: Exactly.
[20:36] <AlexQ> And it I instlal Xubuntu with GRUB already installed, it will add itself to it's config before rebooting
[20:37] <AlexQ> Hopefully
[20:40] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: Yersh...hopefully - but logically, yes, it should be right as rain.
[20:44] <AlexQ> YankDownUnder: OerHeks: So when I create run grub-install --boot-directory=/media/alex/myNewEmptyEXT4/boot /dev/sda'
[20:44] <AlexQ> it will automatically configure GRUB stage 1 to look for it's later stages on the partition that I told it to install GRUB at
[20:45] <AlexQ> i.e. it will look at which partition the directory I chose to is?
[20:45] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: Should
[20:46] <AlexQ> And I guess I should create /boot on that target partition as root first?
[20:47] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: If you've already created a /boot, it should find it
[20:47] <AlexQ> No, I have not, but I want to have grub inside /boot, but I don't have boot, and I don't think that grub-install will create boot
[20:47] <AlexQ> it will probably say that there is no such directory
[20:48] <AlexQ> well, I can try, it won't explode
[20:48] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: No, it won't explode. The world will not end, and McDonald's will still sell junk food.
[20:48] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: Not followed closely .. is this a EFI system ? As then grub install is diffrent .
[20:48] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: BIOS, thx

[20:49] <AlexQ> YankDownUnder: I just don't have a pendrive with me now, and I don't want to leave that friend's computer not working till 2moro or some time, so I'm trying to be careful
[20:49] <AlexQ> :D
[20:50] <YankDownUnder> AlexQ: "Careful" is a good thing. Redundancy is also a good thing. Check and double check...etc etc etc...
[20:50] <TheFatherMind> k1l: dist-upgrade completed and system is rebooted.
[20:51] <TheFatherMind> So to be clear.. there is no way I can prevent ubuntu from removing my apps during the upgrade even though they are already up to date and I do not want them removed.
[20:52] <ppf> if you don't do weird things ubuntu won't remove your software
[20:52] <ppf> what k1l said before
[20:53] <wabbits> define weird
[20:53] <nacc> TheFatherMind: PPAs make things more complicated on distribution upgrades
[20:53] <AlexQ> YankDownUnder: Bashing-om: I'm actually going to extract Xubuntu 16.04 ISO on a new ext4 partition, do update-grub to find that, boot that live Ubuntu and install it on the other new EXT4 I have created, boot it, copy some files from my old unsupported Xubuntu 15.10 and get rid of it.
[20:54] <nacc> TheFatherMind: so when you say "my apps", you need to clarify that you mean "my 3rd party PPA apps", otherwise it comes across as a bit like FUD :)
[20:54] <ppf> nacc, wabbits we discussed this about an hour ago with him already
[20:54] <wabbits> ppf thanks will check the buffer
[20:54] <k1l> TheFatherMind: until you show me the facts i call that is not correct
[20:55] <nacc> ppf: ack :)
[20:56] <k1l> TheFatherMind: and the things you showed so far point in the direction, too.
[20:56] <AlexQ> YankDownUnder: Bashing-om: I hope that seems possible?
[20:56] <Nelluk> is there a good way to figure out what directory on my file system (command line only) is using up a ton of disk space?
[20:56] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: Are you aware of ' sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc ' ? As it will give you the ability to install the boot code to the partition .
[20:57] <k1l> Nelluk: "ncdu"
[20:57] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: Boot code? That partition, you mean the one I want to extract live CD to?
[20:57] <nacc> Nelluk: and there is also 'du', which ncdu wraps around afaict
[20:58] <Nelluk> thank you
=== bennie1 is now known as bennie
[20:58] <k1l> nacc: yes, but du is a bit "limited". ncdu is more loke "baobab" for cli. and i think that is what a common user suits better
[20:58] <nacc> k1l: 100% ack, i didn't even know it existed :)
[20:59] <nacc> k1l: probably deserves to be a faq :)
[20:59] <k1l> yeah, i only got it to know by mouth-to-mouth marketing :)
[20:59] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: You got me confused now, you know. I just hope that now update-grub will find the kernel from live CD extracted to a new ext4?
[21:00] <Nelluk> yes the interface of ncdu is just what i need right now :)
[21:00] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: My understanding is that you are going to dual boot 'buntu's on the same drive, and you want the new install to have it's own boot code separate from that of the MBR ??
[21:00] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: What do you mean by 'boot code'? Later GRUB stages?
[21:01] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: Yeah .. stage 1.5 and 2 in the partition .. ( that is not generally rcommended ) .
[21:02] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: I want to actually MOVE GRUB stages and config to a new, empty ext4 partition because a) I am going to delete the one it is on now later b) I changed the partition table by adding a new ext4 partition before the extended partition that the current partition with /boot/grub is in.
[21:03] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: So I am creating /boot on that partition that I prepared for current Xubuntu LTS and running grub-install
=== bennie1 is now known as bennie
[21:04] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: With appropriate --boot-directory option
[21:05] <AlexQ> lol, GRUB has actually created the boot directory
[21:05] <AlexQ> strange
[21:05] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: If there is to be only one OS installed to the hard drive at some point .. I would not sweat the Grub install . Let ' sudo update-grub ' handle it .
[21:06] <AlexQ> well, I wanted to move the config
[21:06] <k1l> TheFatherMind: you can provide facts for your accusations if you show us the logs in /var/log/apt
=== jackmcbarn_ is now known as jackmcbarn
[21:07] <AlexQ> so I made the root of my new ext4 my current dir and run "sudo grub-install --boot-directory=./boot /dev/sda"
[21:07] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: Why though try and save a old useless config .. when update-grub will make up the new config with current info ??
[21:07] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: I did no try to move an old config
[21:07] <AlexQ> I think after what I did now ^ there is no config now?
[21:08] <AlexQ> But when I run update-grub, will it save it's output to that new ext4?
[21:08] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: Yes, I think that is reasonable to expect .
[21:12] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: It did not find my Live USB image I extracted to the ext4
[21:13] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: And there is no grub.cfg where I installed grub now :<
[21:14] <nicomachus> ugh. If you open an application through ssh and it pops up a desktop notification, then the notification doesn't go away until you kill the ssh connection. whyyy
[21:14] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: Well, that's to be expected. Quoting man update-grub: "update-grub is a stub for running grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg to generate a grub2 config file."
=== IdleOne is now known as Guest46640
[21:16] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: Yeah .. where I am now ; see: man grub-mkconfig . for fine control of grub : ->
[21:16] <Bashing-om> AlexQ: There are times when you have to be able to see where things in Grub are coming from and you can do that by looking at the output of sudo grub-mkconfig but, sometimes the output is too long to show in terminal.
[21:16] <Bashing-om> I entered sudo grub-mkconfig > mkconfig-output to produce an output that can then be opened with gedit to view. It saved to my home directory.
[21:17] <AlexQ> -o solves that
[21:17] <AlexQ> or | less
[21:17] <AlexQ> yeah, I have my grub.cfg now
[21:17] <AlexQ> How can I make GRUB boot my extracted Xubuntu LIVE?
[21:18] <Nelluk> k1l: so i cleared out 12gb of space by running apt-get autoremove (confirmed space with df -h). but im still getting errors about disk space unavailable when i try to run apt-get purge now. the only thing close to 100% usage in my df -h is my /tmp directory..
[21:18] <AlexQ> I guess it doesn't find the kernel and vmlinuz 'cause they are inside /casper, not inside /boot?
[21:18] <k1l> Nelluk: did you look at df -h and df -i?
[21:19] <k1l> Nelluk: and do you have a seperate /boot?
[21:19] <AlexQ> k1l: He actually wrote he did

[21:21] <person19376> Hi all. I am trying to run ubuntu on my HP laptop, but it's having some insane heating issues. After about 2 minutes of use, the computer completely halts(like screen goes black and power goes down with no warning) from the GPU reaching crit. temps. This does not happen in windows 7(duel-boot). Any ideas?
[21:21] <nicomachus> Bray90820: some odd dbus errors there
[21:21] <matti> Nelluk: No, you don't have too.
[21:22] <Nelluk> matti: can you give me command for that please?
[21:22] <Bray90820> nicomachus: My system also freezes with chrome
[21:22] <person19376> (Currently, I took the keyboard off, and am blazing 3 huge fans at the mobo to keep the laptop relatively cool)
[21:22] <matti> Nelluk: What is happening - your /tmp is on / (root) rather than a separate partition/mount point.
[21:22] <nicomachus> Bray90820: this is a Surface 3?
[21:22] <matti> Nelluk: And you have run out of space, so the /tmp was mounted as overflow (usually ~1MB)
[21:22] <Bray90820> yes it is
[21:22] <Nelluk> makes sense
[21:23] <Bray90820> nicomachus: Yes it is a surface 3 non pro and From the information I can gather it looks like a graphics issue
[21:23] <matti> Nelluk: sudo umount -lf /tmp
[21:23] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: That's cool, thanks. I'll try to boot that ext4 first though, as I have already extracted that ISO there and I think it should work.
[21:23] <k1l> matti: ah, i was just reading about that setup. good to know
[21:23] <matti> k1l: :)
[21:23] <Nelluk> matti: seems to have solved it. thanks to you and k1l
[21:23] <matti> Sorry for butting in, by the way :)
[21:24] <person19376> I have rules out hardware failure because on windows 7 nothing happens, I just swapped a RAM chip to be safe, and I installed "lm-sensors" to monitor temps.
[21:24] <person19376> *ruled
[21:24] <k1l> matti: no, issues. this channel is for peer review :)
[21:24] <Nelluk> would rebooting have solved it too? that would have been my next step :P
[21:24] <nicomachus> Bray90820: did you have Ubuntu installed on this Surface before 16.10? did 16.04 work ok?
[21:25] <matti> Nelluk: It would.
[21:26] <matti> Nelluk: It is a "safety" mechanism, so to speak.
[21:26] <Nelluk> gotcha
[21:26] <nicomachus> Bray90820: there are some odd errors in this log that make it seem that the OS doesn't like the hardware all too much.
[21:26] <Nelluk> well we're back in business now. thanks again
[21:26] <nicomachus> i.e.: [drm:pwm_setup_backlight [i915]] *ERROR* Failed to own the pwm chip
[21:26] <nicomachus> plus a ton of ACPI errors, etc.
[21:26] <Bray90820> nicomachus: I didn't have 16.04 installed very long but from what I can remember it did work
[21:27] <Bray90820> I might have installed the intel graphics driver i don't remember
[21:27] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: YankDownUnder: So my old 15.10 boots correctly with GRUB later stages and config now on a new partition (made sure it uses the new location by manually changing one menuentry in grub.cfg)
[21:27] <TheFatherMind> k1l: sorry for the delay I had a client call me. Are you looking for the history and term log?
[21:27] <matti> Nelluk: If you run out of space, a lot of things tryin to use/write files under $TMP/$TMPDIR would fail with either ENOSPC or EACCES, which could cause them to freak out.
[21:27] <Bray90820> nicomachus: 16.04 had a mess of other unrelated issues tho
[21:28] <matti> Ah, he's gone.
[21:28] <nicomachus> Bray90820: can you get to a terminal now and try running "sudo lshw" and paste to a pastebin then link here?
[21:28] <k1l> TheFatherMind: yes. that is where it gets logged what happens with apt

[21:40] <corbin_> How do I get an Ubuntu Forums thread reopened? I have critical details to contribute so a helpful thread can apply to Ubuntu 16.04.
[21:40] <k1l> TheFatherMind: remove what exactly?
[21:40] <TheFatherMind> No because I have not upgraded that computer yet.  I am trying to make it NOT remove them when I upgrade.

[21:42] <k1l> TheFatherMind: amd you might be confused with the upgrader disabling the 3rd pary repos to make sure the upgrade gets not corrupted by 3rd party packages. but you can activate them afterwards
[21:42] <OerHeks> TheFatherMind, read back, why should i repeat endlessly?
[21:42] <lion4407> anyone using ubuntu 13.10 with box now?
[21:42] <lion4407> virtualbox
[21:42] <nicomachus> lion4407: no one should be.
[21:42] <TheFatherMind> they were not disabled.. they were REMOVED as in I had to get the .deb file and install them again.
[21:42] <TheFatherMind> or add the repository and install them again.
[21:42] <lion4407> nicomachus, why you say that?
[21:42] <nicomachus> lion4407: because it's not supported any more.
[21:43] <Ben64> lion4407: it hasn't been supported since July 2014
[21:43] <TheFatherMind> Let me get you the log files from the computer they were removed from.
[21:43] <nacc> TheFatherMind: kodi is in the archives for 16.04, as is transmission?
[21:43] <k1l> TheFatherMind: that is wrong. ubuntu got no such mechanism to do that.
[21:43] <lion4407> nicomachus, what is not supported I'm a little confused?
[21:43] <nacc> lion4407: ubuntu "13.10"
[21:43] <OerHeks> nacc, he had kodi installed on 14.04, from ppa. kodi was not in our repos then.
[21:43] <nicomachus> !13.10 | lion4407
[21:43] <ubottu> lion4407: Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) was the 19th release of Ubuntu. Support ended on July 17th, 2014. See !eol, !upgrade and http://ubottu.com/y/saucy
[21:43] <lion4407> oops
[21:43] <lion4407> lol
[21:43] <lion4407> sorry
[21:44] <TheFatherMind> Well actually the logs have been rotated so I have no idea what ones contain the upgrade logs
[21:44] <lion4407> 16.10 lol
[21:44] <lion4407> sorry
[21:44] <nacc> OerHeks: right, but it is now, so it could be removing the ppa version to install the archive ones?
[21:44] <lion4407> anyone using 16.10 with virtualbox?
[21:44] <nacc> OerHeks: not sure how that works, tbh
[21:44] <Ben64> lion4407: ok so what's your actual question
[21:44] <OerHeks> nacc, manually after upgrade, ppas do not survive dist-upgrade
[21:44] <k1l> TheFatherMind: /var/log/dist-upgrade/
[21:45] <TheFatherMind> k1l: did you just say that ubuntu did not remove my apps during the release upgrade?
[21:45] <nacc> OerHeks: yes i understand, but as we've all said, ppas aren't purged either; so 'kodi' is installed before dist-upgrade; during dist-upgrade, kodi is found in the archives, so it will upgrade that package, afaict
[21:45] <lion4407> well that is my first question :). because I've tried it with my usb and it's not booting and I have used with 16.04 without any major problems... Ben64
[21:45] <lion4407> but I don't see anyone else having any issues
[21:45] <Ben64> lion4407: ok so describe your issue
[21:45] <lion4407> I just did
[21:45] <OerHeks> nacc, afaik no
[21:45] <lion4407> it wont boot
[21:45] <k1l> TheFatherMind: the things you state dont make any sense.
[21:45] <Ben64> lion4407: in detail
[21:46] <nacc> OerHeks: ok, that's what i wasn't sure about; given that the package is still installed (regardless of from where in the case of ppa or archive), how would the dist-upgrade know not upgrade kodi? Unless you pin it?
[21:47] <lion4407> Ben64 well I got some ext4 errors several times....I'm able to boot straight into the usb directly without a problem but with virtualbox it won't boot in...I either get errors or blank screen....ben64
[21:47] <OerHeks> nacc, even pinning does not work for 14.04 > 16.04 .. in this time he could have upgraded and installed again.
[21:47] <Ben64> lion4407: use the iso file
[21:47] <nacc> OerHeks: ah ok
[21:47] <OerHeks> but no, he wants a switch to keep it, which is not the ubuntu way.
[21:48] <lion4407> ben64 I don't want to do that because I like sometimes booting straight into ubuntu directly...I was able to do that without any major problems with 16.04
[21:48] <AlexQ> Bashing-om: Didn't work with no parameters, there was no /boot in fstab etc. Will try tomorrow with seed and boot=casper etc. options
[21:48] <TheFatherMind> k1l: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2925120/dist-upgrade.tar
[21:48] <AlexQ> Night to all
[21:48] <Ben64> lion4407: you can do that with the iso
[21:48] <lion4407> ben64 i like having it on a usb...
[21:48] <stackmon> Hi! I have just installed Ubuntu 16.04.1 on an iMac, and when I lock the screen, it stays on although with all black displayed and my mouse cursor in the middle. Is there a way for the monitor to be powered off when the system is locked?
[21:48] <TheFatherMind> I am glad to hear that k1l.  That means this is solvable.
[21:49] <lion4407> ben64 I mean booting in without windows
[21:49] <Ben64> lion4407: you don't make any sense
[21:49] <lion4407> ben64 with a iso you need a OS right?
[21:49] <Ben64> no
[21:49] <stackmon> Google is only telling me how to turn off the gnome-screensaver stuff. I don't have gnome-scrensaver, i just want my monitor to power off when locked/inactive
[21:49] <lion4407> ben64 you mean with a DVD
[21:50] <person19376> Im rebooting to see if the changes helped
[21:50] <Ben64> no, i mean an iso, like i just said
[21:50] <OerHeks> k1l, oh dear, now you have to tell him that upgrading to 16.04 does not keep packages
[21:50] <lion4407> ben64 how are you suggesting I run the iso with my pinky lol
[21:50] <Bray90820> nicomachus: http://pastebin.com/raw/8GmUeSg1
[21:50] <Ben64> lion4407: pinky?!
[21:50] <Ben64> lion4407: the hell are you talking about
[21:50] <lion4407> is ben64 a troll?
[21:50] <nacc> lion4407: no
[21:51] <lion4407> how does he expect to run the iso?
[21:51] <Ben64> you boot it with virtualbox!
[21:51] <lion4407> ben64 with what OS?
[21:51] <nacc> lion4407: you're asking to run 16.10 in virtualbox, right?
[21:51] <nacc> lion4407: or do you mean virtualbox in 16.10?
[21:51]  * Ben64 facepalms
[21:51] <lion4407> omg
[21:51] <lion4407> run usb 16.10 in virtualbox
[21:52] <nicomachus> Bray90820: ok, possible issue there. one sec.
[21:52] <lion4407> virtualbox runs in a OS like windows and linux right?
[21:52] <Bray90820> nicomachus: Thanks
[21:52] <nacc> lion4407: yes, it's a tool for virtualization
[21:52] <lion4407> virtualbox run in s a OS right?
[21:52] <nacc> lion4407: so you want to run 16.10 in virtualbox? just pass virtualbox the iso file
[21:53] <lion4407> <lion4407> ben64 I mean booting in without windows
[21:53] <lion4407> <Ben64> lion4407: you don't make any sense
[21:53] <nacc> lion4407: i think that's what ben64 was saying?
[21:53] <OerHeks> lion4407, if virtualbox gives you a blank screen, go into the vm settings and give more memory to the gpu and check other settings perhaps?
[21:53] <lion4407> I want to run ubuntu without virtualbox sometimes...without windows
[21:53] <nacc> lion4407: so you want to run the live usb?
[21:53] <lion4407> yes
[21:53] <nacc> lion4407: you're asking two different questions, then?
[21:53] <lion4407> no
[21:53] <lion4407> wait
[21:53] <Ben64> you're asking how to run 16.10 in virtualbox WITHOUT VIRTUALBOX
[21:53] <lion4407> hang on
[21:53] <Ben64> !!!!
[21:54] <nacc> Ben64: :)
[21:54] <Ben64> please explain, with excessive detail, exactly what you're trying to accomplish
[21:54] <lion4407> ben64 listen and read this carefully.....I have ran 16.04 with a usb in virtualbox...im having trouble running 16.10 with virtualbox but not booting straght into live usb...
[21:55] <lion4407> i want to be able to do both!!!!!
[21:55] <lion4407> i dont need help with live usb booting
[21:55] <Ben64> use the iso for virtualbox
[21:55] <lion4407> i need help with the virtual box
[21:55] <person19376_> Hi. Thanks all for the tips on my HP laptop. I turned off my big noisy fans, and it appears to be keeping its cool(albeit while sacrificing the quietness of the fans). I mean, for me, anythings better than being forced into using windows 7 ;)
[21:55] <lion4407> live usb ben
[21:55] <lion4407> not iso
[21:55] <Ben64> same thing
[21:55] <Ben64> but you need to use the iso for virtualbox
[21:55] <lion4407> well I already have a live usb what are you talking about?
[21:56] <Ben64> i'm talking about you need an iso to boot with virtualbox
[21:56] <lion4407> no you don't
[21:56] <lion4407> phlop boot manager buddy
[21:56] <Ben64> oh, because it's working?
[21:56] <nicomachus> Bray90820: lots going on here ^^, but I'm still looking. You have a multimedia device unclaimed, which means we're probably missing a driver.
[21:56] <lion4407> I TOLD YOU I HAVE DONE THIS IN 16.04
[21:56] <Ben64> i'm telling you to use the iso
[21:56] <nicomachus> lion4407: you need an ISO. plop only helps to boot an iso.
[21:56] <lion4407> phlop boot manager
[21:57] <nicomachus> it's plop, not phlop.
[21:57] <nacc> lion4407: please stay calm, even if you are frustrated
[21:57] <lion4407> you can boot with live usb with phlop boot manager
[21:57] <Bray90820> nicomachus: Thanks
[21:58] <zacharypch>  hey after updating to 16.10, GTK applications such as libreoffice and others have goofy layouts around the menu items and such, is this a known thing? anyone know a fix for that?

[21:58] <lion4407> what and learn
[21:58] <lion4407> watch
[21:58] <Ben64> lion4407: cool story. now use the iso or figure it out yourself
[21:58] <lion4407> ben64 your a fucking idiot

[21:59] <nicomachus> Bray90820: trying to figure out which driver is missing here. having a time.
[22:00] <k1l> TheFatherMind: ok, look at the main.log the thing is, that the do-release-upgrade disables the 3rd party repos not to mess the update process with broken packages. then it looks at what to install from the xenial repos. then it marks kodi as obsolete because there is no repo for it. but the do-release-upgrade will ask you if it should remove those packages at all. you can say no, enable the 3rd party repo again. and then run update+upgrade and then autoremove
[22:00] <Bray90820> nicomachus: Wish i could help
[22:00] <stackmon> so, i have my brightness & lock set to dim screen and turn off after 1 minute inactivity, but when it does that, the screen doesn't actually turn off, rather it just turns all the pixels black. I can still see my mouse cursor, and I'm sucking power to diaplay black pixels. Is there a way to get it to actually turn the monitor off.
[22:00] <stackmon> ?
[22:01] <nicomachus> reposting this in hopes of a second pair of eyes seeing what I'm missing: http://pastebin.com/raw/8GmUeSg1. This is Bray90820's lshw. *-multimedia UNCLAIMED caught my eye.
[22:02] <Bray90820> nicomachus: It might be my trackpad
[22:02] <nicomachus> stackmon: use the Suspend setting in your power settings.
[22:02] <nicomachus> Bray90820: why would a trackpad be powered by the Intel chip though?
[22:02] <stackmon> won't suspend also kill all the services?
[22:02] <Bray90820> nicomachus: Good point not my trackpad I am out of ideas now haha
[22:03] <nicomachus> stackmon: nah.
[22:03] <stackmon> hm okay, I will give that a try, thanks
[22:03] <person19376_> stackmon: Techinically, (assuming a perfect CPU), "suspending" is just saving the current line of code to RAM and turning the CPU as off as it can go without being off.
[22:03] <nicomachus> stackmon: also, in Brightness & Lock settings, there's a "Turn screen off when inactive for: " option
[22:04] <stackmon> nicomachus: thank you. I have set the turn screen off when inactive to 1 minute, but when the 1 minute expires, i get the black pixels.
[22:04] <nicomachus> what kind of machine is this? laptop or desktop? is it an external monitor?
[22:05] <TheFatherMind> k1l: so you are saying that I said "yes" to something that I should have said "no" to. And if I pay more attention this will not be a problem.
[22:05] <k1l> TheFatherMind: yes
[22:06] <TheFatherMind> I understand what you said, and why it happened.  Thank you SO SO SO much for being so patient and persistant with me.  Your efforts are appreciated.
[22:06] <stackmon> nicomachus: that didn't work. The services did halt including network :(

[22:22] <niytro> hey folks, I was wondering if anyone had some insight on super cookie removal in ubuntu? or if it is even an issue? I do have browser-plugin-freshplayer-pepperflash installed. I use chromium with adblock pro, ScriptSafe, EditThisCookie and https everywhere,
[22:24] <kk4ewt> niytro,  myself adblock is now crappy i use ublock origin it does a better job and uses less resources
[22:24] <kk4ewt> i use ublock origin on about 100 machines
[22:24] <niytro> kk4ewt, ill check it out right now, any thoughts on super cookies?
[22:25] <kk4ewt> i tell the browser no to allow cookies that track
[22:25] <nicomachus> adblock sells whitelisting. :/ uBlock Origin is the way to go.
[22:25] <lordcirth> kk4ewt, have you considered a DNS-layer blocker if you have that many machines?
[22:25] <nicomachus> make sure it's Origin, not just regular uBlock.
[22:25] <nicomachus> or use pi-hole, like lordcirth is probably about to suggest.
=== jelatta_away is now known as jelatta
[22:26] <kk4ewt> lordcirth,  if they were all desktops yes but they are lappys
[22:26] <lordcirth> nicomachus, those in general, yes
[22:26] <niytro> kk4ewt, also there are like 3 different versions of adblock, adblock pro is supposed to block ALL with low resource usage.. it claims. I did disable 3rd party cookies and checked the option to clear cookies on browser shut down
[22:26] <nicomachus> kk4ewt: if you block it at the network level, it works with all devices. laptops, desktops, mobile, etc
[22:26] <kk4ewt> nicomachus,  but they travel to different networks
[22:26] <lordcirth> nicomachus, not if the laptop isn't on the network you manage.
[22:26] <nicomachus> that's true.
[22:27] <lordcirth> You could set DNS to yours, but then that's a separate config change and a failure point
[22:27] <kk4ewt> nicomachus,  take a look at security now last year with steve gibson he wholeheartedly says ublock origin is better
[22:28] <kk4ewt> lordcirth,  i dont control the dns
[22:28] <nicomachus> kk4ewt: right... I said that.
[22:28] <lordcirth> kk4ewt, I meant setting the DNS settings on the laptops
[22:28] <kk4ewt> adblock pro even sells whitelist as well
[22:29] <Guest34260> anyon know why apt would fail on finding Packages, via a local mirror even tho theyre there?

[22:31] <Guest34260> its there though o.O
[22:31] <lordcirth> Well, perhaps the path is up or down one dir by accident, or something
[22:31] <Guest34260> i copied the url for the paackages and pasted it into chrome, loads fine.
[22:32] <Guest34260> not sure whats deal is
=== Guest34260 is now known as gorelative
[22:32] <lordcirth> Guest34011, what about the URL for Release ?
[22:32] <gorelative> https://apt.devita.co/puppet/dists/xenial/PC1/binary-amd64/Release
[22:32] <gorelative> same thing
[22:32] <gorelative> its there
[22:32] <lordcirth> Doesn't resolve for me, but I'll take your word for it
[22:33] <nicomachus> doesn't load here either, no matter how I play with the URL
[22:33] <gorelative> yeah it wont
[22:33] <gorelative> its internal only
[22:34] <gorelative> sources.list.d/puppetlabs-pc1.list looks liket his
[22:34] <gorelative> https://apt.devita.co/puppet xenial PC1 main
[22:34] <gorelative> main doestn exist though on xenial puppet
[22:35] <nicomachus> so it's an internal site to whatever network you guys are on?
[22:35] <gorelative> yup
[22:35] <gorelative> internal mirror
[22:36] <nicomachus> not much we can do then. from the paste it looks like there is no xenial package available. but we can't verify.

[22:40] <gorelative> k itll take a min to reesolve nicomachus, you could add to /etc/hosts and resolve devita.co to apt.devita.co to try it out
[22:41] <gorelative> looks like it resolved most the way around
[22:41] <gorelative> try again?

[22:48] <guest100> So, anyone know how to get a version of bridge-utils installed on ubuntu? I want to set up a router with both wired and wifi, but b-u is not in apt, and I need it.
[22:49] <OerHeks> devslash, i wouldn't think of upgrading ubuntu 16.04 > 16.10 in a virtualbox thingy.
[22:49] <devslash> why ? I did it with past version and its always worked fine
[22:51] <squinty> guest100:   bridge-utils    - Utilities for configuring the Linux Ethernet shows up in repos here on 16.04
[22:52] <guest100> I'm on 14.04, that may be why...
[22:54] <lordcirth> !info bridge-utils trusty
[22:54] <ubottu> bridge-utils (source: bridge-utils): Utilities for configuring the Linux Ethernet bridge. In component main, is optional. Version 1.5-6ubuntu2 (trusty), package size 28 kB, installed size 142 kB
[22:55] <squinty> guest100:  it also show on  my 14.04 as being available
[22:55] <guest100> Wait, wot.
[22:55] <guest100> Then why on here does it show up not found?
[22:56] <bardock> hello
[22:57] <ShayBox> would anyone know how i could setup "start (command/path here)" to launch a second X session with openbox and that program? i've gotten the cmd working, but i cant get both openbox and the program to launch at the same time...
[22:58] <squinty> guest100: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=bridge-utils&searchon=names&suite=trusty&section=all
[22:58] <bardock> do you mean two X session at the same time?
[22:59] <ShayBox> Yes, but the second one running as :1 and vt8 (i got that working)
[22:59] <campeche> ey
[22:59] <Ivana> Hello
[22:59] <Ivana> :)
[23:00] <campeche> como esta la comunida
[23:00] <Bashing-om> !es | campeche

[23:01] <Ivana> can someone help me, when i run sudo apt-get update, i get Invalid 'Date' entry in Release file /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/developer.download.nvidia.com_compute_cuda_repos_ubuntu1604_x86%5f64_Release
[23:02] <lordcirth> Ivana, that probably means that nvidia's repo has an invalid Date entry.  Are you sure you need that repo?
[23:03] <bardock> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultiseatX
[23:03] <Ivana> yeah
[23:03] <Ivana> lordcirth I need cuda :/
[23:04] <lordcirth> Ivana, I assume you mean a more recent version of cuda?  Because cuda is in main repos
[23:04] <ShayBox> and i need a gpu that will work with higher than nvidia-340 but we dont always get what we want lol
[23:05] <Ivana> lordcirth what im trying to do is install tensorflow, it is telling me it needs Cuda toolkit 7.5 and CUDNN
[23:05] <lordcirth> !info nvidia-cuda-toolkit
[23:05] <ubottu> Package nvidia-cuda-toolkit does not exist in yakkety
[23:05] <lordcirth> !info nvidia-cuda-toolkit xenial
[23:05] <ubottu> Package nvidia-cuda-toolkit does not exist in xenial
[23:05] <lordcirth> Oh, I guess I have a ppa too
[23:06] <Ivana> i have a gtx 1070 if it helps at all
[23:07] <lordcirth> 'apt show nvidia-cuda-toolkit' tells me it's in Multiverse
[23:07] <Ivana> i dont know what that means lol
[23:07] <lordcirth> One of the official repos
[23:07] <lordcirth> Then why doesn't ubottu show it?
[23:07] <guest100> Ah, found the problem, maybe. I didn't update the install after the original install from ISO.... So many packages to update....
[23:08] <lordcirth> Ivana, look in /etc/apt/sources.list and see if multiverse is enabled
[23:08] <ShayBox> @bardok i got it working, openbox and the program launch in a new X session, but if i run that session as root it wont start openbox... any reason why?
[23:09] <Ivana> i see a lot of entries, how do i know which are enabled?
[23:09] <Ivana> there are a few lines with the term multiverse in it
[23:10] <lordcirth> Ivana, well, are they commented out or not?
[23:10] <Ivana> nope
[23:11] <lordcirth> then they are enabled
[23:11] <Ivana> okay
[23:11] <Ivana> i think i need to remove that line  that im getting the error from before using other packages though
[23:11] <lordcirth> And therefore you should have a 'nvidia-cuda-toolkit' package in main repos
[23:11] <lordcirth> Yes, you need to remove the nvidia ppa
[23:12] <Ivana> do you know how to do that by any chance?
[23:12] <bardock> @Shaybox good question!
[23:13] <User123> Hey, guys. Trying to use gs to merge some PDF files but getting "Error: /undefinedfilename". Could I link to the Pastebin that has my code and see if anybody could help out?
[23:13] <Bashing-om> Ivana: If this helps : " sysop@x1604:~$ apt list nvidia-cuda-toolkit >> nvidia-cuda-toolkit/xenial 7.5.18-0ubuntu1 amd64 " It is there .
[23:13] <bardock> @Shaybox try to open the openbox app as root after the two session has been launch
[23:14] <ShayBox> that works
[23:14] <ShayBox> but it wont start with it :/

[23:16] <ShayBox> @bardock heres the script im using, its the ArchWiki's one with some slight changes http://paste.ubuntu.com/23346239/ maybe that will give some insight
[23:16] <Ivana> i dont know how to remove the ppa
[23:17] <squinty> !ppa-purge
[23:17] <ubottu> To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: ¬´ sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> ¬ª ‚Äì For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[23:18] <surgy> can someone please help me to get minecraft to work? im running 16.04 lts
[23:19] <ShayBox> surgy add the "peeps ppa" on google, then sudo apt-get install minecraft-installer (thats how i do it)
[23:19] <Ivana> okay i just rm -rf it from the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ and it works now
[23:19] <Ivana> hopefully i never broke annything
[23:19] <surgy> ShayBox, got a tut?
[23:19] <Ben64> surgy: not really on topic here, but 1. install java, 2. download minecraft, 3. java -jar minecraft.jar
[23:20] <ShayBox> surgey, http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/easily-install-minecraft-in-ubuntu-via.html (follow that)
[23:20] <surgy> Ben64, thats what i tried first
[23:20] <Ben64> surgy: and?
[23:21] <niytro> I've done an archbang installation with LVM on LUKS and I edited GRUB to pull a keyfile from a USB stick to unlock the partitions. Is this possible with a full disk encryption install of Ubuntu 16.10?

=== daniel__ is now known as chaospsychex
[23:23] <chaospsychex> i'm on ubuntu 12.04 and I can't get root access after turning on automatic logins
[23:24] <niytro> chaospsychex, im a newbie but i read root is disabled by default and sudo is recommended?
[23:24] <chaospsychex> niytro, doesn't work
[23:24] <chaospsychex> niytro, says my password is wrong when i know it's right
[23:25] <niytro> chaospsychex, can you change your password in the users app?
[23:25] <lion4407> well i looked online and others are having issues
[23:25] <gorelative> looks like Packages isnt on the ubuntu archive
[23:25] <chaospsychex> niytro, no because i can't even unlock it
[23:25] <lion4407> apparently there is a problem
[23:25] <Caluser2000> That's interesting. What about su?
[23:25] <gorelative> http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/xenial/main/binary-amd64/
[23:25] <gorelative> no Packages..
[23:25] <niytro> chaospsychex, reinstall?
[23:26] <chaospsychex> i've basically broken 12.04 by turning on auto login
[23:26] <chaospsychex> niytro, are you serious? wow
[23:26] <niytro> chaospsychex, you said you didnt have access but its on auto login?
[23:26] <ShayBox> people still use 12.04...?
[23:26] <niytro> thats what i was thinking
[23:26] <Caluser2000> Why not
[23:26] <chaospsychex> yes people still use 12.04
[23:26] <chaospsychex> god damn
[23:26] <surgy> ShayBox, i installed from peeps and now it tries to start but doesnt
[23:26] <niytro> seems pretty dated but i guess if it does the intended job
[23:26] <Caluser2000> If it works.
[23:27] <ShayBox> surgy, can you paste.ubuntu.com the error if there is one?
[23:27] <chaospsychex> Caluser2000, thank you for logic
[23:27] <niytro> chaospsychex, my bad i assumed it was maybe a fresh install
[23:27] <OerHeks> chaospsychex, you might be in trouble, 12.04 is EOl and you missed important fixes that are used in the wild. nobody can tell if you are hacked.
[23:27] <surgy> ShayBox, i dont know how to start it from terminal...... so it just flashes the icon in the unity bar for a few seconds and goes away
[23:28] <Caluser2000> chaospsychex: I'm using an even older distro. ;)
[23:28] <ShayBox> oh right, run "java -jar /usr/share/minecraft/minecraft.jar" in terminal
[23:28] <rhollan> Is there a snappy core chatroom anyone knows about?
[23:28] <OerHeks> #snappy
[23:29] <rhollan> thanks, wasn't sure
[23:29] <niytro> I did a full disk encryption install on 16.10, is it possible to have grub unlock the drive from a keyfile on a usb stick instead of entering a password?
[23:29] <surgy> ShayBox, A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:

[23:30] <ShayBox> surgy: can you type java -version and tell me the version?
[23:32] <surgy> openjdk version "9-internal"

[23:33] <ShayBox> yea... maybe try getting java 8, package "default-jre"
[23:33] <surgy> ShayBox, how to purge openjdk?
[23:34] <surgy> is it sudo apt-get purge openjdk-/*
[23:34] <lordcirth> niytro, a quick search finds this: http://www.pavelkogan.com/2014/05/23/luks-full-disk-encryption/
[23:34] <ShayBox> sudo apt-get autoremove --purge openjdk-*
[23:37] <surgy> ShayBox, thnx brah! come to #surger sometime!
[23:41] <et09_> how is radeon support on linux these days?
[23:43] <niytro> et09_, im running mobility radeon in my laptop and since ubuntu 16 there is no more proprietary driver support for the time being, its open source drivers only, performance in CS:GO is kinda meh compared to W7
[23:44] <et09_> it's for employees @ job not involving 3d rendering
[23:44] <et09_> just trying to make sure it's not really glitched - proprietary or OSS O
[23:44] <et09_> OK *
[23:45] <niytro> my ubuntu 16.10 runs very well
[23:45] <ShayBox> my KDE Neon (16.04 based) works well
[23:45] <ShayBox> but im on nvidia.. so Kappa
[23:45] <niytro> lol
[23:55] <Bray90820> Someone was helping me with ubuntu 16.10 and this is the information they found
[23:55] <Bray90820> reposting this in hopes of a second pair of eyes seeing what I'm missing: http://pastebin.com/raw/8GmUeSg1. This is Bray90820's lshw. *-multimedia UNCLAIMED caught my eye
[23:55] <Bray90820> Anyone have an answer to those errors?
[23:57] <df00z1> Hey - there are several key packages that conflict with eachother.  Should I email the package maintainers?  http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/amd64/libxi-dev/filelist  http://packages.ubuntu.com/yakkety/i386/libxi-dev/filelist for example
[23:57] <df00z1> there are open bugs too,
[23:58] <dxiri> guys, I need my server to have the old naming conventions instead of the new ones, running ubuntu 16.04
[23:59] <dxiri> how can I do that? I have set some kernel options but they are not working for some reason
