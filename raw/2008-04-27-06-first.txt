[05:53] <tokyoahead> guys my menus and email lists in Thunderbird are extremely small... firefox is OK though. how can I change it? in the preference is a display-tab with fonht sizes but that changes o0nly the email text, not the menus etc
[05:53] <alien> only
[05:53] <Co2> oh your using gnome
[05:53] <Gman99999> maco ok
[05:53] <alien> Co2: advanced desktop settings
[05:53] <cky> M1dn1ght: That is definitely possible.
[05:53] <Gman99999> maco so what to do now ? lol
[05:53] <alien> Co2: there is that for compiz config settings manager, but like i said whatever i enable i see no eye candy :P
[05:53] <M1dn1ght> Yes - I got to that point - I added "noapic" and "acpi=off" after pressing e, and then pressing b to boot it still freezes, so I am thinking perhaps that it was not those options, but the safe mode I selected with F4?
[05:53] <maco> Tanaric: ooo yeah quit it and then install those two packages, then run "sudo dpkg --configure -a" to finish configuring everything
[05:54] <Co2> you need to change your window manager from gnome to compiz
[05:54] <ubuntu_> sweet a chat thing cool
[05:54] <Tanaric> Great, thanks maco!
[05:54] <M1dn1ght> If this is so, is there a method to do such a thing with main installation?
[05:54] <cky> M1dn1ght: So do safe mode. Then, pick "resume" when the menu comes up, and see how far you get then.
[05:54] <alien> Co2: how
[05:54] <maco> Gman99999: cky suggested reinstalling.  thatd mean reboot and choose recovery mode from the menu and then run "aptitude reinstall sudo"
[05:54] <Gman99999> maco should this be reported as a bug?
[05:54] <Co2> i did it with the compiz fusion icon
[05:54] <alien> Co2: i dont have one ;(
[05:54] <Co2> i right clicked the icon in the sys tray and changed the settings in there..
[05:55]  * cky learnt how to reinstall a package. Thanks maco! :-)
[05:55] <Gman99999> ok
[05:55] <Tweaker> Why does pidgin freeze when I stream videos? Is there a problem wrong with the codec?
[05:55] <M1dn1ght> After I press escape at grub, is this the location where I must select safe mode?  the boot loader is different from install
[05:55] <Tanaric> maco: Actually, it's completely frozen -- keyboard and mouse are not responding. Ctrl+Alt+Backspace isn't even killing X. Any advice?
[05:55] <Meshezabeel> most dvds will not play under ubuntu, yet some play, I am guessing it is some sort of codec problem as they are good discs and the drive itself is good. Any ideas what I need to install?
[05:55] <alien> Co2: hey i havent updated anything in ubuntu yet
[05:55] <maco> Gman99999: unless you can tell what happened to make the configuration file go missing...like if you can say "when i installed <program> it deleted my /etc/sudoers" no
[05:55] <cky> M1dn1ght: Yes, that's where you put your cursor at safe mode, hit "e" to add those acpi parameters, and then boot as usual.
[05:55] <alien> Co2: i have 210 updates to update
[05:55] <Co2> try that.
[05:55] <alien> Co2: some of the stuff in there is compiz ..
[05:55] <alien> Co2: last time i did it mesed up my grub
[05:55] <Gman99999> maco ok I see
[05:56] <alien> Co2: .. il ltry that
[05:56] <maco> Tanaric: alt+sysrq+t
[05:56] <GTroy> !offtopic
[05:56] <ubotu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, #ubuntu+1 supports the development version of Ubuntu and #ubuntu-offtopic is for random chatter. Welcome!
[05:56] <Co2> kk
[05:56] <mouseclone> Meshezabeel: Gstreamer codecs
[05:56] <Gman99999> maco is there a way to undelete it/
[05:56] <Gman99999> ?
[05:56] <maco> Tanaric: if the kernel's responding, that take you to a text console
[05:56] <macd> alien, 'sudo apt-get install fusion-icon' after you update.
[05:56] <Tanaric> maco: nothin'.
[05:56] <maco> Gman99999: you could make a new one...from recovery mode
[05:56] <alien> macd: ok
[05:56] <Tanaric> Though I suspect it's just hotplug failed -- I use one USB keyboard/mouse for both machines here
[05:56] <Gman99999> maco ok Ill beback
[05:56] <M1dn1ght> I will try that now and report back shortly.  Also, if I might ask if you know a method for making the "function+F10" key combination turn on my wireless adapter in ubunti?
[05:56] <roachmmflhyr> what package is kernel-headers in?
[05:57] <alien> Co2: thanks mate
[05:57] <maco> Tanaric: even if you hold it down for like 10 seconds? sometimes it takes a while...mine does
[05:57] <alien> macd: thanks :0 ill try right after update
[05:57] <B_166-ER-X> to the 2 guys who tried to help me with my Nvidia -hardy- problem... well, i rebooted...then at the loggin screen the Font was REAALLYY Tiny, and the reste liek 800X600 ...I had to go back and reconfigure xorg so i could enter my password (for some reason the language was mixed up) , and then i logged in. Re-checked the 'Activate' nvidia drivers...rebooted, andi get a black screen beside of the login screen now.
[05:57] <macd> roachmmflhyr, for searching packages, 'apt-cache search packagename' works well ;)
[05:57] <cky> M1dn1ght: No, sorry, because Fn+F10 doesn't perform that function on my laptop. :-P
[05:57] <maco> Gman99999: you need to know what to put in there
[05:57] <B_166-ER-X> I'm on Windows For the moment.
[05:57] <Co2> macd is my friend  :)
[05:57] <Co2> :D
[05:57] <Co2> HIHI MACD!
[05:57] <alien> woot
[05:57] <FloodBot2> Co2: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:57] <alien> 1.2 megs a second update
[05:57] <Co2> sorry
[05:57] <alien> lol
[05:57] <alien> 1.2 kb/s
[05:57] <roachmmflhyr> macd: I know kernel-headers package exists but it says it is referenced by another package
[05:57] <Co2> macd warned me not to do that lmao
[05:57] <maco> Gman99999: but if you run "visudo" from recovery mode, that should take you through it.  <esc>:wq is save in visudo
[05:57] <alien> 1.2 megs lol
[05:57] <M1dn1ght> I will try and reboot now.  thank you cky
[05:57] <alien> kbs im tired
[05:57] <macd> roachmmflhyr, hardy?
[05:57] <cky> M1dn1ght: Good luck!
[05:58] <roachmmflhyr> macd: yes
[05:58] <cky> maco: I thought default editor was nano? Maybe not anymore.
[05:58] <macd> roachmmflhyr, linux-headers-generic
[05:58] <Tweaker> Why does streaming videos freeze my IM client?
[05:58] <roachmmflhyr> macd: thanks
[05:58] <Tanaric> maco: Nope, definitely not responding. I suspect it's just hotplug that's shut down because of the half-completed upgrade, though -- I use one USB keyboard/mouse for both machines.
[05:58] <Gman99999> maco I have no idea how to use visudo lol maybe reinstalling it would be easier
[05:58] <macd> roachmmflhyr, or -server, etc if thats what you have
[05:58] <maco> cky: it is, but does that extend to visudo?
[05:58] <cky> maco: Yes.
[05:58] <maco> Gman99999: reinstall should generate the right thing
[05:58] <Gman99999> visudo I was trying to change something in it earlier and I believe this is how it got all messed up
[05:59] <B_166-ER-X> so, well , HArdy / Nvidia drivers problem here :) , wasnt able to Activate (well, was activated, but 'no in used, so said the driver manager) but now all i get is a black screen at login screen. help ?
[05:59] <pawan> my nvidia graphics card not working with hardy
[05:59] <pawan> it was working with gutsy
=== c is now known as Charitwo
[05:59] <maco> cky: ah didnt know that. i changed editor and bash's input mode to vi a while back
[05:59] <cky> maco: Maybe not anymore (I just strings'd visudo). It used to.
[05:59] <Meshezabeel> mouseclone, any idea which gstreamer package? I have most of them installed
[05:59] <roachmmflhyr> macd: thanks
[05:59] <cky> maco: No, I don't know if it has anything to do with the bash input mode (although I'm a "set -o vi" user myself).
[05:59] <B_166-ER-X> pawan, welcometo the club
[05:59] <szx0> I'm curious if anyone here has used VirtualBox?
[06:00] <pawan> thanks
[06:00] <patifa> szx0 yep
[06:00] <cky> maco: But it used to use sensible-editor because it drove me up the wall, and reminded me that I needed to run "update-alternatives --config editor".
[06:00]  * pclynch smiles while upgrading to 8.04
[06:00] <szx0> patifa, What is the seamless mode like?
[06:00] <maco> cky: no i mean, i set $EDITOR=vi and set -o vi
[06:00] <pawan> where is the club
[06:00] <cky> maco: Like I said, strings seems to suggest it doesn't do that now. Maybe.
[06:00] <roachmmflhyr> macd: package doesnt exist
[06:00] <mouseclone> Meshezabeel: you will also have to know if the DVD is DRM or some type of encryption.. might not be supported by linux
[06:00] <cky> maco: Got it.
[06:00] <macd> !source
[06:00] <ubotu> You can easily fetch a package's source with apt-get. See: http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-sourcehandling.en.html
[06:00] <szx0> patifa, does it really feel like a blend of two O/S ?
[06:00] <maco> cky: i only know one other person that does set -o vi
[06:01] <macd> roachmmflhyr, that source line was directed at you
[06:01] <patifa> running windows as a guest, ubuntu as the host, seemless was pretty good.  I can't remember if the window manager reconized the windows or not, though.
[06:01] <patifa> I broke my windows guest install, however.
[06:01] <cky> maco: I don't literally "set -o vi", I have "set editing-mode vi" in my .inputrc. But same diff. :-P
[06:01] <szx0> patifa, k thx
[06:01] <maco> cky: combine with capslock-is-escape, and i get people all mixed up in my terminal;
[06:01] <patifa> But, literally, you get the guest OS's windows on your desktop
[06:01] <B_166-ER-X> problem with Nvidia and hardy..please. :/ (i have a black screen after boot at login screen)
[06:01] <m1dn1ght> Thank you Cky - this is doing the trick for me!!
[06:01] <lartza_> Upgrade won't work
[06:02] <maco> cky: they hit capslock and end up in command mode and then cant figure out how to type
[06:02] <cky> maco: Well, if it's any reassurance for you, I use Dvorak, so that confuses most people too. :-P
[06:02] <cky> m1dn1ght: That's neat to know! :-)
[06:02] <m1dn1ght> However - can you recommend me perhaps where I may make this an automated process?
[06:02] <mouseclone> ﻿Meshezabeel: I think that GStreadm extra plugins fromt the add/remove will help if you do not already have it
[06:02] <cky> maco: Hahaha!
[06:02] <patifa> And the linux guest additions for 8.04 don't work anymore
[06:02] <maco> cky: worst was when i had SCIM set to use shift+space and theyd start typing in japanese in the terminal
[06:02] <lartza_> I starts to say "Problem in program and Firefox browser closed unexpectedly and then that it can't update some program and setup closes
[06:02] <brunner> ﻿is apachectl normally packaged with apache?
[06:02] <InfernoX222> Does anyone have a moment to help fix my nvidia driver issue?
[06:02] <cky> maco: That's bitten me before, and I learnt to release the shift key before hitting space.
[06:03] <brunner> because I installed apache2, and I can't find it
[06:03] <maco> cky: me too.  they didnt.
[06:03] <lartza_> It says retty many programs and some of them are .py files
[06:03] <B_166-ER-X> InfernoX222 were a bunch with this problem it seems :/
[06:03] <cky> maco: Hehehe. :-)
[06:03] <milly1234> firefox 3 makes me want to hit inanimate objects....
[06:03] <alien> anyone know a good game for linux :P
[06:03] <B_166-ER-X> milly1234 i've already gone back to FF 2 ;)
[06:03] <LSG> Milly1234: Indeed!
[06:03] <maco> cky: i finally removed SCIM from mom's comp after she typed in extra-wide numbers in OOo and got confused
[06:03] <cky> alien: frozen-bubble
[06:03] <MrGnu> Hey, does anyone know of an issue with Hardy when you upgrade, where Amarok is choosing to use the motherboard sound chip instead of your sound card?
[06:03] <Tweaker> Enemy Territory
[06:03] <maco> alien: wesnoth, frets on fire
[06:04] <B_166-ER-X> alien- arena

[06:04] <philip_> is totem crashing in hardy when playing an avi file for anyone?
[06:04] <MrGnu> I was just in the Amarok chat room, but people are either asleep or whatever
[06:04] <nickrud> brunner have you tried apache2ctl ?
[06:04] <brunner> ﻿apache2ctl?? how annoying
[06:04] <mouseclone> Dopewars is fun
[06:04] <alien> ok
[06:04] <InfernoX222> B-166-ER-X: yah i just upgraded but cant go about 800x600 in either program for my rez
[06:04] <Tweaker> I love Dopewars :)
[06:04] <MrGnu> But this seems to be a hardy issue
[06:04] <brunner> nickrud: I just figured that out
[06:04] <brunner> thanks
[06:04] <MrGnu> any help?
[06:04] <HAX_TEH_GIBS0N> Hey guys
[06:04] <maco> MrGnu: *just* amarok?
[06:04] <Tweaker> Anyways, why does Pidgin freeze when I stream videos?
[06:04] <maco> !hi | HAX_TEH_GIBS0N
[06:04] <ubotu> HAX_TEH_GIBS0N: Hi! Welcome to #ubuntu!
[06:04] <MrGnu> Yeah, its just Amarok maco
[06:05] <milly1234> i honestly think they should have put ff2 in hardy, and when ff3 became finalized give it as an upgrade option or something
[06:05] <mouseclone> alien: I'm also a fan of scorched 3D
[06:05] <maco> MrGnu: other sound apps are fine?
[06:05] <MrGnu> yeah
[06:05] <milly1234> ff2 as default that is
[06:05] <m1dn1ght> Hax_Teh_Gibson - that movie was almost as bad as your nick :P
[06:05] <MrGnu> All other sound apps are ine
[06:05] <MrGnu> fine
[06:05] <B_166-ER-X> InfernoX222 i upgraded yesterday...finnaly had to reinstall completely..and now nvidia drivers wont load, and i have no sound at all :) (thats what i can an 'UPGRADE' ;) )
[06:05] <MrGnu> Playing through my soundblaster card
[06:05] <MrGnu> Its just Amarok
[06:05] <mouseclone> alien: if you like the old cannon / worms games
[06:05] <HAX_TEH_GIBS0N> Dudes, my Ubuntu 8.04 now boots into BusyBox after updating everything via Synaptic. If anyone can help, would be much appreciated. If you need me to be specific about any details, tell me. :p
[06:05] <maco> milly1234: ff3b5 is awesome though...much less mem usage and nicely integrated with gtk2

[06:05] <djdeep> ﻿my ati x1900gt runs with the  fglrx driver, but my grafik fan is very fast. how can i fix this ?
[06:05] <InfernoX222> ﻿B-166-ER-X: damn... i think i might have to do a reinstall... if i could revert to the drivers i had before i would be fine... but i cant do that
[06:06] <InfernoX222> or rather i cant figure that out
[06:06] <B_166-ER-X> Firefox 3 barely supports addons..
[06:06] <milly1234> but it comes with neat features like... 100% CPU usage at random times, while freezing.
[06:06] <LSG> djdeep Hey i have the same card. Did you notice the animations are not as fluid as Gutsy's? Or is it just me?
[06:06] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: Sound is more than likely related to 2.6.24-12 kernel
[06:06] <HAX_TEH_GIBS0N> if anyone could help me, I'd be extremely grateful.... ;_;
[06:06] <MrGnu> lol terrible Milly1234 .. but I am sure that the addons situation has to change soon
[06:07] <smallfoot-> B_166-ER-X, firefox works fine for me with Adobe Flash, adblock, noscript
[06:07] <B_166-ER-X> mouseclone, ok.. is that deadly doc ?
[06:07] <Gman99999> maco I can't figure out how to boot into recovery mode, its been changed since the last update, obviously to keep newbs out from wrecking stuff
[06:07] <MrGnu> Well, Im going to try to do a reboot Maco, I dont think Im going to get anywhere anytime soon
[06:07] <alien> waiitt
[06:07] <MrGnu> Adios all
[06:07] <alien> waiit
[06:07] <maco> Gman99999: what? its not the second option?
[06:07] <alien> who said scorched 3d!
[06:07] <alien> is a genous
[06:07] <maco> MrGnu: are you on ubutnu or kubuntu?
[06:07] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: deadly doc?
[06:07] <MrGnu> Ubuntu
[06:07] <cky> Gman99999: You still just hit escape at GRUB, and pick option 2, like maco says.
[06:07] <mouseclone> B_166-ER-X: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.24/+bug/200338
[06:07] <B_166-ER-X> looking at how good goes my hardy upgrade, i think FF3 and Hardy goes well together.
[06:07] <maco> MrGnu: kde apps use a different way to access pulseaudio than ubuntu apps do
[06:08] <maco> MrGnu: er, than gnome ones do
[06:08] <alien> mouseclone: heyyyy
[06:08] <alien> mouseclone: scorched 3d :P
[06:08] <iRRVi> ubuntu 8.04...problem with audacity...cannot open sound device...you know what im talkin about...
[06:08] <milly1234> ff3 looks good yes... but is far from stable.
[06:08] <maco> MrGnu: is the pulseaudio esd plugin enabled?
[06:08] <B_166-ER-X> mouseclone thx
[06:08] <mouseclone> alien: you get it?
[06:08] <Gman99999> cky i picked the recovery mode in grub and it sends me to this screen and i have 3 options 1st one is to send me back to normal mode and i cant remember the rest

[06:09] <djdeep> the grafik fan runs fast why ?
[06:09] <cky> Gman99999: No, you don't get a GUI, it's just there to allow you to recover your system.

[06:09] <cky> Gman99999: Pick option 2, then either "visudo" or "aptitude reinstall sudo". :-P
[06:09] <cky> Then "exit" and option 1 when you're done.
[06:09] <maco> Gman99999: or just run "aptitude reinstall sudo" to regenerate the config
[06:09] <LSG> djdeep: My card's fan is running normally...
[06:10] <cky> maco: Jinx!
[06:10] <maco> cky: ;)
[06:10] <maco> MrGnu: or "reboot" when you're done to...ya know...reboot

[06:11] <B_166-ER-X> so did i.
[06:11] <maco> laeg: havent looked at ufw, but im thinking thats for *inbound* but irc is *outbound*
[06:11] <nickrud> Gman99999 dpkg won't replace altered/removed files unless you tell it to explicitly; for yours I'd do sudo apt-get remove --purge sudo && apt-get install sudo
[06:12] <B_166-ER-X> but i cannot even log into my ubuntu now, all i get is a black screen after bootup :/
[06:12] <cky> NW2190: You need to add gtkmm's includes directories to your -I option too.
[06:12] <maco> Gman99999: listn to him. he makes sense.
[06:12] <iRRVi> everything except audacity works with audio...tried everything i could find...from `killall esd`ing to messin with the sound preferences
[06:12] <Gman99999> maco lol
[06:12] <LSG> djdeep: I have no idea what could be causing that, never happened to me. Sorry.
[06:12] <nickrud> Gman99999 and hope you have sudo in the package cache, network doesn't come up by default in recovery mode
[06:12] <Gman99999> nickrud thank you
[06:12] <blankhead> B_166-ER-X: did u mess around with the xorg.conf file?
[06:12] <cky> NW2190: Put $(pkg-config --cflags gtkmm-2.4) to your build line.
[06:12] <maco> nickrud: i thought reinstall would act like that so it could fix things
[06:12] <mouseclone> lartza_: if you have a burner download the upgrade from http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
[06:12] <milly1234> audacious seg faults on me...
[06:12] <maco> nickrud: it doesnt? weeeird
[06:13] <Gman99999> nickrud how i configure the network?
[06:13] <cky> NW2190: If you're using a Makefile, just have "CFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --cflags gtkmm-2.4)"
[06:13] <mouseclone> lartza_: and check the box for alternate desktop
[06:13] <B_166-ER-X> blankhead i did a 'dpkg reconfigure' because my keyboard was all mixed up (azerty)
[06:13] <milly1234> I had to write my xorg.conf by hand in Hardy
[06:13] <lartza_> mouseclone: In installing packets it said "Firefox closed unexpectedly" hard to tell exactly cause I use finnish system. It gave me many errors with different programs closing like volumecontrol.py and then it stopped by couldn't update packet, but I don't remember the name
[06:13] <cky> NW2190: You will then also need "LDFLAGS += $(shell pkg-config --libs gtkmm-2.4)"
[06:13] <maco> Gman99999: to start network run "/etc/init.d/networking start"
[06:13] <nickrud> maco the package management system assumes you knew what you were doing when you changed config files. So, it will leave any altered ones alone
[06:13] <djdeep> when i deaktivate the grafik card and test vesa the fan isnt fast
[06:13] <mouseclone> lartza_: this will prevent packet errors due to over utlized servers and lack of bandwidth
[06:13] <B_166-ER-X> milly1234 jsut remove the crossfade plugin with synaptic
[06:13] <InfernoX222> does anyone know how to revert graphics drivers to teh hardy default?
[06:13] <johnny_> i knew it..
[06:13] <milly1234> B_166-ER-X, thank you.
[06:13] <maco> nickrud: linux assumes a lot about users' skill levels ;)
[06:13] <lartza_> mouseclone: Why did the update do that?
[06:13] <laeg> can somebody help me open a port range in ufw? it won't accept 6881-6999
[06:14] <B_166-ER-X> np
[06:14] <johnny_> anybody here had a problem with upgrades failing due to libGl.so.1
[06:14] <nickrud> Gman99999 I think all I had to do was sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
[06:14] <NW2190> cky: when I put the (pkg-config --cflags gtkmm-2.4) in I get an "unexpected '(' message.
[06:14] <lartza_> Update to gutsy from feisty was shitty too...
=== Jarwo is now known as paijo
[06:14] <blankhead> B_166-ER-X:oh man was it neccessary to do that all that..im sorry i couldnt help im a noob to linux i havent ever reconfigured dkpg or anything like that
[06:14] <djdeep> what grafik driver you have installed ?
[06:14] <cky> NW2190: You need a $ sign too. :-)
[06:14] <alien> ahhhhhhh
[06:14] <nickrud> Gman99999 I had a wired connection then, wireless would be harder
[06:14] <alien> nvmd
[06:14] <iRRVi> yarhg
[06:14] <crdlb> NW2190: it's $() not ()
[06:14] <LSG> djdeep: The restricted drivers
[06:14] <nickrud> maco it's a debian thing, they think sys admins ;)
[06:14] <bubblegumtate> I just upgraded and flash sound has stopped working, anyone know a fix?
[06:14] <maco> Gman99999: and you wouldnt use sudo when you start networking in recovery mode
[06:14] <Gman99999> nickrud ok i have a wired one thank you, this is an interesting learning experience for sure
[06:14] <blankhead> B_166-ER-X: i was just wondering cuz i know if u mess up the xorg.conf theres a way to fix it but sorry man
[06:15] <Gman99999> maco yea i figured that lol
[06:15] <B_166-ER-X> np
[06:15] <mouseclone> lartza_:  I did a live update once.  I have always downloaded the alt CD from then on.  With doing the live upgrade so close to release you end up with internet traffic problems.  That is from my experiance
[06:15] <maco> Gman99999: kk :)
[06:15] <Gman99999> maco nickrud thanks so much guys
[06:15] <nickrud> did I say sudo :)))
[06:15] <Gman99999> lord almighty
[06:15] <ghalib> anyone able to help me out in getting my sound to work in quake4? im running fiesty x64, and got the game running, but no sound
[06:15] <iRRVi> im goin to bed....be back tomarro askin the same question >_< hopefully theres less people talkin so i can get my problem solved...(not that its a bad thing that so many people are getting they're problems solved...but whatever...)
[06:15] <maco> nickrud: oh...rh doesnt assume skill?

[06:16] <nickrud> maco I only used rh 7.3 for a short time, I've been debianized for a long time.
[06:16] <mouseclone> ghalib: do you have sound with anything else?
[06:16] <NW2190> cky: oh ya that worked, sort of.  It looks like it found the file, but it still doesn't compile and since Its an example on the gtkmm website I figure it should...
[06:16] <lartza_> mouseclone: I didn't have bandwidth issues. Issues came on package install.
[06:16] <ghalib> ya
[06:16] <MrObvious> Wow my wireless is slow on my BCM94311 and the B43 driver. I'm only connecting at 2Mbps and it feels really laggy. :(
[06:16] <NIghtFire> and they said 8.04 was stable and safe? It may be but looks like it don't work worth a hoot.
[06:16] <nickrud> DJDarkstar that's right, you're using the 3d drivers correctly
[06:16] <lartza_> Last time they were bandwidth erros
[06:16] <ghalib> i can run sound with all my other apps

[06:17] <nickrud> maco as long as things are consistent and there's a policy for looking for new things it's all good
[06:17] <maco> laeg: oh
[06:17] <mouseclone> lartza_:  Like I said.  From my experiance those package issues are from a bad package due to it missing a packet or 2.

[06:18] <deshawn> quick question, does ubuntu use the same font format as windows?
[06:18] <maco> quasar8888: via compiling or package managers or...hat?

[06:20] <nickrud> djdeep that's a different issue from having the right driver. Don't have that card so I've never messed with fan speed

[06:20] <MrGnu> Hey Maco, thanks, It was in the settings
[06:20] <maco> quasar8888: nerds use their command line counterparts, and people helping here do as well because the command line is always the same, whereas kde has adept instead of synaptic
[06:20] <MrGnu> Just wanted to let you know, great job, thank you for helping me again!
[06:20] <Byan> crdlb: hmm, ok
[06:20] <quasar8888> I really want to install DEV-C++
[06:20] <djdeep> i can hear a difference between the systems
[06:20] <cky> NW2190: Okay, your program compiled fine. It just didn't link fine.
[06:21] <maco> quasar8888: to use add/remove or synaptic or adept, just search for what you want, mark the checkbox, and hit apply
[06:21] <Vlet> I've never understood why online tutorials that are giving instructions on how to do fairly simple things, or in chatrooms like this where people are asking notice questions, why people instruct them to use vi
[06:21] <cky> NW2190: What is the command line you're using to build it?
[06:21] <lartza_> mouseclone: Adn a dozen of other progs, when i updated o gutsy i did a terminal upgrade cause the graphical failed ot fetch something, but now it's really differen
[06:21] <nickrud> Vlet cuz it's on every system. Not all have pico or nano
[06:21] <MrGnu> maco: The reboot did not work but when I chose the actual alsmixer instead of autodetect that repaired the problem.
[06:21] <maco> Vlet: usually we recommend nano...except for like...me...because i dont have nano's stuff memorized and i can tell vi commands easily
[06:21] <cky> Vlet: Because vi is the lowest common denominator, except ed. :-P
[06:21] <patifa> yeah VLet, vi is not a program for a novice.
[06:21] <maco> MrGnu: ok
[06:21] <cky> Vlet: Maybe ed is a better choice, I guess. :-P :-P :-P
[06:21] <MrGnu> Good night all

[06:22] <Radtoo^laptop> Or tell them about :w and :q. :D
[06:22] <maco> Vlet: all *nix systems have vi, so online that makes sense. here, nano's the default recommendation because it's guaranteed to be on all ubuntu systems

[06:23] <NW2190> cky: haha ya.
[06:23] <m1dn1ght> oh - I thought this was a temporary thing.  I assumed once I had ubuntu up and running I could download the appropriate drivers maybe?

[06:27] <djdeep> for some ati cards you can install the "radeon" driver
[06:27] <cky> m1dn1ght: It might not be supported. The info I have is at http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsispart1.shtml#12
[06:27] <cky> m1dn1ght: I don't know if that's the most up-to-date info though.
[06:27] <LSG> djdeep: For Linux?
[06:27] <B166erx> exactly
[06:27] <nickrud> m1dn1ght m1dn1ght there's a driver for it, I gotta remember
[06:27] <evilbug> if i install the new nvidia driver for my geforce 4 mx and it doesn't work,can i just reconfigure xserver after to restore everything to normal? [i'm running 7.10]
[06:27] <djdeep> yes
[06:28] <mouseclone> evilbug: it should have made a back up of your xorg.conf file.  You can just rename that as well
[06:28] <LSG> djdeep: I don't know man, i always use the restricted drivers, they work fine
[06:28] <B166erx> my ubuntu is still more silent than a dead weasel. though. (but it have nice graphic to cope now :) )
[06:28] <Gman99999> nickrud now when i use sudo this is what it says, I reinstalled it btw "g is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported."
[06:28] <m1dn1ght> thank you for the info!  I will hope nickrud remembers this driver while I look on this page you send CKY

[06:30] <sirhcjw> my account seems to be not working
[06:30] <Gman99999> nickrud ok some packages also got uninstalled when i reinstalled sudo, like iced tea and stuff like that
[06:30] <sirhcjw> i can't login
[06:30] <evilbug> i want to install it because video playback is pretty bad.
[06:30] <cky> m1dn1ght: That's a shame. :-(
[06:30] <nickrud> m1dn1ght install xserver-xorg-video-sis (duh)
[06:30] <mouseclone> B166erx:  I don't really know.. I stopped looking after if found the answer about the audigy card
[06:30] <evilbug> thanks guys,i'm going to go see what happens :)
[06:31] <samliu> yeah if you want to overclock thats the only time it makes a difference
[06:31] <samliu> good luck :D
[06:31] <B166erx> ok
[06:31] <sirhcjw> "Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info
[06:31] <Willizar> is there a "msn messanger " tha i can use my mic and headphones
[06:31] <nickrud> Gman99999 whatever did you do to your system? (I don't care for iced tea, I like my caffeine strong anyway
[06:31] <samliu> ok im out for the night
[06:31] <sls> how can i copy movies for IPod that i have to my ipod in hardy?
[06:31] <maco> m1dn1ght: my rule is "the more hardware is made my intel, the better"
[06:31] <milly1234> anyone know of a tv tuner pci card that supports ATSC and will not make my usb webcam vanish making it as thew only video input device?
[06:31] <maco> sls: gtkpod
[06:31] <m1dn1ght> sorry for awkwardness, but I am linux newbie.  Do I just type that command in terminal?
[06:31] <milly1234> that works good with ubuntu
[06:31] <sls> ok
[06:32] <dupin> hi
[06:32]  * mouseclone is unsure if the new gtkpod will do mv4 movies yet
[06:32] <Gman99999> nickrud all I did was type in aptitude reinstall sudo and it said yes or no lol
[06:32]  * mouseclone has not tested
[06:32] <alien> maco: http://pastebin.com/m13415038
[06:32] <Gman99999> nickrud this is crazy all this trouble over one file
[06:32] <nickrud> m1dn1ght   sudo apt-get install  xserver-xorg-video-sis , then log out and back in. If X is as smart as it's supposed to be now, it should recognized the driver
[06:32] <Willizar> i need "msn messanger " tha i can use my mic and headphones
[06:32] <deshawn> is linux the most secure OS every created?
[06:32] <cky> nickrud: I thought that driver is installed by default.
[06:33] <cky> nickrud: Also its manpage doesn't mention 671 or 771...hmm....
[06:33] <deshawn> a friend tells me it is the most secure OS ever created, is that true?
[06:33] <maco> alien: umm...is it not working after it says that?
[06:33] <Starnestommy> deshawn: I think OpenBSD is, but Linux is very secure
[06:33] <nickrud> Gman99999 you probably didn't loose anything important, but it's a good idea to write down things like that
[06:33] <tokyoahead> how can I add a user to a certain group?
[06:33] <maco> deshawn: your friend hasnt heard of openbsd
[06:33] <alien> maco: i see no change
[06:33] <mouseclone> deshawn: NO! but it was never hacked in the PWN to OWN contest
[06:33] <Leeuw> willizar, kopete has support for webcams and  mics.
[06:33] <pradalvr> whenever i try to use the update manager i get an error "Failed to fetch cdrom:[Ubuntu 8.04 _Hardy Heron_ - Release i386 (20080423)]/dists/hardy/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz Please use apt-cdrom to make this CD-ROM recognized by APT. apt-get update cannot be used to add new CD-ROMs" can someone tell me what this is...I am new to Ubuntu so don't get too technical
[06:33] <maco> alien: no new icon in your notification area?
[06:33] <LSG> Is anyone else having crappy animations? And a way around it maybe...?
[06:33] <speedhunt3r> hey how do you fix enabling desktop effects without it getting rid of the top window bar of every window?
[06:33] <nickrud> cky says all sis chips in the package description. No idea if it's on the cd
[06:33] <Willizar> nickrud:  you are the hacker, you are the man i need you can you help you helped me the last time and no one else
[06:33] <Gman99999> nickrud ok Im going to use the command adduser g admin and I'll be back in a few
[06:33] <mouseclone> deshawn: if you want the most secure OS then don't plug your computer into a network
[06:34] <Willizar> Leeuw:
[06:34] <B166erx> mouseclone , ok , jumping to another problem (altough probably much simple to solve)   i have 3 hard drives, 2 others than this one, i can 'mount' them but i would like them to be 'auto mounted' on boot
[06:34] <m1dn1ght> Cky/Nickrud: http://pastebin.com/m2f55ea3c
[06:34] <Willizar> Leeuw:  i ahve the kopete but i dont know how
[06:34] <maco> deshawn: the only secure computer lacks both a network card and a power supply
[06:34] <nickrud> eww, msn
[06:34] <cky> m1dn1ght: *nods*
[06:34] <mouseclone> deshawn: rule of thumb - this is all created with 0s and 1s, and it can be undone with 1s and 0s
[06:34] <m1dn1ght> should I logout/login now?
[06:35] <alien> maco: ahh
[06:35] <m1dn1ght> I don't think it changed anything, right?
[06:35] <nickrud> m1dn1ght sounds like you have it.   do   gedit /var/log/Xorg.0.log , and copy and paste to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
[06:35] <alien> maco: i see it now but i might of messed something up when i did fusion-icon from terminal
[06:35] <randin-> is there anyway to revert the hda to sda conversion in hardy?
[06:35] <nickrud> m1dn1ght nope, no change
[06:35] <maco> alien: you have to right click it to get the menu from it
[06:35] <Leeuw> Willizar: go to settings, the bottom item is ' devices'  , here you can switch it on
[06:35] <Fuzzy> is there a mini booting version of the 8.04 cd's?
[06:35] <mouseclone> B166erx: sudo vi /etc/fstab
[06:35] <maco> mouseclone: nano!
[06:35] <yuri_> hey guys, is there a quick command line way to find out which version a certain package is?
[06:35] <cky> yuri_: dpkg -l package-name
[06:35] <mouseclone> maco: sorry
[06:36] <maco> B166erx: instead of vi, use nano...itll save headache
[06:36] <B166erx> i'm a Gedit guy nyway;)
[06:36] <nickrud> yuri_ apt-cache policy package
[06:36] <yuri_> cky thanks
[06:36] <maco> B166erx: if you want to use gedit, use gksu instead of sudo
[06:36] <yuri_> nickrud: thanks as well
[06:36] <cky> nickrud's answer is better if the package isn't installed yet. :-P
[06:36]  * mouseclone uses console for most things
[06:36] <djdeep> @lsg have you aktivate the cube ?
[06:36] <Willizar> Leeuw:  there are options only for the cam
[06:36] <LSG> djdeep: Yup
[06:36] <maco> mouseclone: someone was just in here saying we scare newbies with vi and i was saying we default to nano around here. yer makin me a liar
[06:36] <nickrud> also doesn't crop long versions/names ;)
[06:36] <maco> mouseclone: :P
[06:36] <m1dn1ght> Cky/Nickrud: http://pastebin.com/m638cc43c
[06:37]  * mouseclone hangs head in shame
[06:37] <Fuzzy> is there a mini booting version of the 8.04 cd's?
[06:37] <mouseclone> sudo gedit /etc/fstab
[06:37] <djdeep> ok i activate it, but then the 3d games dont run then anymore
[06:37] <nickrud> m1dn1ght ok, it sees the sis chip but is using the vesa driver.  now show us /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:37] <maco> mouseclone: gksu on graphical apps. sudo + graphical = possible uh oh
[06:38] <dupin> hi
[06:38] <Willizar> nickrud:  when you would be free just call me ok?
[06:38] <LSG> djdeep: Yeah you can't have the cube and 3D games at the same time.
[06:38] <mouseclone> maco: kk
[06:38] <cky> nickrud: Bear in mind it's using vesa driver because of using safe graphics mode, apparently using non-safe graphics mode crashes the computer? So I was told.
[06:38] <djdeep> why ?
[06:38] <LSG> djdeep: Just deactivate it whenever you're playing.
[06:38] <mouseclone> maco: i will try to remember that
[06:38] <cky> nickrud: So definitely good to keep the safemode xorg.conf around just in case.
[06:38] <djdeep> yes i do this
[06:38] <nickrud> Willizar eww, msn and kopete ;) Anyway, I've never set up a camera and mike before
[06:38] <zl3cat> I have cube and 3d games and fullscreen movies atr the same time
[06:38] <djdeep> because why
[06:38] <B166erx> mouseclone, i know you cant do much with distance .. but, is there a simple way to know.. what to enter here ? i already done this, buta few ubuntus  back .. :/
[06:38] <Willizar> ok nickrud
[06:38] <nickrud> cky yup. I always have them copy it to xorg.conf.beforenickrudmuckedabout ;)
[06:39] <bod_> hey guys -- after having major problems with hardy and sound i reinstalled on clean partitions using text installer which faailed installing things, so i did thesame aggain but installed through hardy live cd now i get Grub error 22 when i boot -- ive tried super brub disk -- can anyone help?
[06:39] <LSG> djdeep: Dunno...maybe having to render a 3d space withing a 3d space is too much?
[06:39] <cky> nickrud: Hehehe!
[06:39] <m1dn1ght> http://pastebin.com/d46f3f753
[06:39] <mouseclone> B166erx: use vol_id /dev/harddrive to get the UUID
[06:39] <LSG> djdeep *within
[06:39] <maco> zl3cat: some drivers hate it
[06:39]  * nickrud wonders how many machines have his nick in them
[06:39] <B166erx> thx
[06:39] <zl3cat> get an nvidia then :)
[06:39] <maco> zl3cat: youre lucky if you can do that.
[06:39] <Leeuw> Willizar: maybe I was wrong about the mic; I can' t check now, my kopete' s broken...   But Kopete has plugins too, probably there' s one for mics, go to th menu in contact list, configure plugins, check there if there' s one, else follow the link to see if you can download one.    There' s also another prog for msn: emesene, try that ?
[06:39] <zeeeee> hi, after upgrading from 7.10 to 8.04, typing in filenames doesn't take me to the file anymore in nautilus or the open file dialog... did this get disabled? can i enable it?
[06:39] <cky> m1dn1ght: I bet you $10 that nickrud's suggestion is change the vesa to sis. :-)
[06:39] <Willizar> kopete its a KDA program so lets ask kubuntu
[06:39] <Willizar> :D
[06:40] <cky> m1dn1ght: Because that would be my first suggestion too.
[06:40] <nickrud> m1dn1ght see cky above ;)
[06:40] <maco> zl3cat: well theyre most recent drivers have caused issues, and theyve stopped giving proper support to some cards, so that's not even a great answer anymore
[06:40] <djdeep> when you play a video for example with vlc d divx the qualitiy isnt so good like windows
[06:40] <m1dn1ght> when I booted, I had to press esc at grub, select "recovery", then e, then "noapic" and "acpi=off".  I then had to press b, then select resume.  As cky said, this process may mean I am giving you poor information
[06:40] <djdeep> why
[06:40] <LSG> zl3cat: I'm happy with my ATI =) I don't play games anyway
[06:40] <spideyman> how do i get my script to open terminal since the prog it envoke is a terminal prog? it works good but i cant see what its doing
[06:40] <mouseclone> B166erx: you will end up with UUID=something    /where/you/want/it/mounted   filesystem(etc3)      relatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1
[06:40] <zl3cat> gtg l8r
[06:41] <bod_> bazhang: hey dude, are you about?
[06:41] <evilbug> the nvidia-glx-new doesn't work for me.
[06:41] <nks_> Maybe someone can help me out there ! - I would like to know if someone knows how to enable graphics acceleration on a Mac 2.16 ghz. laptop with ubuntu 8.04 using vmware !
[06:41] <m1dn1ght> OK - change vesa to sis makes sense.  Do I make this change in xorg.conf?
[06:41] <nickrud> m1dn1ght no, that's a different hardware issue (probably)
[06:41] <bazhang> bod_: hi!
[06:41] <cky> m1dn1ght: Did you get a chance to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst in the end, and add those options to your kopt line?
[06:41] <cky> m1dn1ght: Yes, in that file.
[06:41] <bazhang> your computer still sooty, bod_? ;]
[06:41] <mouseclone> B166erx:  the easiest thing to do is copy the line above it and change the UUID and the / or mount point
[06:41] <osmosis> what package gives the 'host' command ?
[06:41] <cky> m1dn1ght: e.g., "kopt=root=... ro noapic"
[06:41] <m1dn1ght> Cky - I was trying to figure out the editor command.  I know now it's gedit :)
[06:41] <Tjh__> hey guys i tried to use the new CD for  ubuntu
[06:41] <maco> mouseclone: i think we need a graphical way to edit /etc/fstab
[06:41] <nickrud> m1dn1ght do:   cd /etc/X11 && sudo cp xorg.conf xorg.conf.beforenickrudmuckedabout && sudo gedit xorg.conf   , then edit vesa to sis. Save, log out and back in
[06:41] <m1dn1ght> so I have yet to make permenant those changes
[06:41] <bod_> bazhang: hey bazhang,.,. im angry with hardy now -- can you help me with a GRUB error 22 issue plz? that was my dads compi was on while mine was BORKED!!!
[06:41] <djdeep> the faces are little bit crap
[06:42] <cky> m1dni1ght: Oh, sorry, I meant "# kopt=root=... ro noapic" (don't strip out the #).
[06:42] <mouseclone> B166erx: also make sure that if you use /home/username/folder that folder exist
[06:42] <yuri_> i need some advice. im running 7.10 right now and do not have a pressing reason to upgrade to 8.04. what is at stake here?
[06:42] <bazhang> hang on bod_ let me check something
[06:42] <dupin> Tjh__ :and?
[06:42] <bod_> yuri_: dont uprade for a few more weeks (at least)
[06:42] <B166erx> mouseclone , yeah i got that ;)     altought, i think its late. my brain is half asleep, running on geekness alone a 1:42 am.
[06:42] <cky> nickrud: For graphical programs always use gksudo. :-)
[06:42] <bod_> bazhang: k, cheers m8
[06:42] <JohnnyWells> Are there any WORKING programs I can use to remove the DDRM on my Itunes library?
[06:42] <maco> m1dn1ght: except where it says "sudo gedit" make that "gksudo gedit"
[06:42] <Tjh__> when i boot up it gives me the menu, anything i select ends up in "IO error: Boot disk failure"
[06:42] <cky> maco: Yes!
[06:42] <maco> er...what cky said
[06:42] <hydrogen> JohnnyWells: no.
[06:42] <ceil420> what's the command to see where a symlink is pointing?
[06:42] <Tjh__> or smthg along those line
[06:42] <nickrud> cky oh my god, I've said that thousands of times ;(. I even know why ;-p
[06:42]  * bod_ notices no one talks to him unless they no him
[06:42] <spideyman> how do i get my script to open terminal since the prog it envoke is a terminal prog? it works good but i cant see what its doing
[06:42] <Tjh__> *lines
[06:42] <bazhang> bod_: is this a dual boot or only ubuntu
[06:42] <yuri_> bod_: are there still major bugs to be worked out?
[06:43] <bod_> bazhang: dual
[06:43] <hydrogen> ceil420: readlink
[06:43] <B166erx> mouseclone , my question now, is, Hardy Auto detect and 'auto name' the Hard drive 'Media **gig'   , wont if make a conflict ?

[06:43] <maco> yuri_: sloooow repositories
[06:43] <mouseclone> B166erx: same time here.. but I do this in my sleep.. mostly server work though on Windows.  I'm just trying to learn Linux mo'better

[06:43] <bod_> yuri_: im definately experiencing them 2 & 1/2 days debugging as we speak
[06:43] <cky> Okay, must go. nickrud sounds plenty capable of seeing you through this, m1dn1ght; all the best!
[06:43] <m1dn1ght> ok - I changed vesa to sis

[06:44] <parkar86> Hello, I need some help recompiling the b43 kernel module for Hardy
[06:44] <bod_> yuri_: no probs -- the beta was exce;;ent the full release seems shabby
[06:44] <bod_> lol
[06:44] <EddieDied> morning, how do I restore initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 from a livecd?
[06:44] <cky> m1dn1ght: I can only hope. :-) Still, glad to be of help.
[06:44] <cky> Uh, too late.
[06:44] <mouseclone> B166erx: right now your drive is more than likely mounted @ /media/disk-1 and /media/disk-2
[06:44] <dupin> Tjh__   : and disc integrity?
[06:44] <maco> yuri_: also there's a bug where none of us are all that used to debugging hardy yet...we're used to how the old stuff worked
[06:44] <ceil420> hmm
[06:44] <ceil420> how can i confirm that a file is a symlink?
[06:44] <Tjh__> eh?
[06:44] <mouseclone> B166erx: it will not automount them once inside of fstab
[06:44] <maco> yuri_: us helpers need to be debugged ;)
[06:44] <B166erx> mousclone something  kie this, yeap
[06:44] <bod_> maco: worked being the operative word
[06:44] <B166erx> ok
[06:44] <sls> ok maybe i am an idiot but there is no obvious way to get movies to my ipod using gtkpod.
[06:44] <nickrud> hahaha, three quarters of the bugs are simply 'changes'
[06:44] <maco> bod_: :P
[06:44] <parkar86> ls -l and see if it points to something in console
[06:44] <dupin> Tjh__ :that is option when you boot CD
[06:44] <ceil420> $ readlink -v Ceil.txt
[06:44] <ceil420> readlink: Ceil.txt: Invalid argument
[06:44] <Tjh__> o i burned onto a CD-RW (is that a problem)
[06:44] <parkar86> colors help
[06:44] <mouseclone> B166erx: well not using automount
[06:45] <yuri_> maco: lol. devs need to be recompiled. gotcha
[06:45] <maco> bod_: well the ways in which the old things failed and the ways to fix them.
[06:45] <EddieDied> apparently I have initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 deleted so I can't boot into ubuntu, how do I restore this file?
[06:45] <blankhead> anyone knows why the media button on the keyboard doesnt pop up the default multimedia app?
[06:45] <mouseclone> B166erx: they will mount when the system starts
[06:45] <bod_> sls: i may be being siully but have u tried dra and drop in nautilus?
[06:45] <B166erx> now, its late , i have a hard time finding the /dev  of my hd's
[06:45] <Arelis> Has anyone here got Ubuntu looking -EXACTLY- like Vista?
[06:45] <bod_> maco: yeah ;|)
[06:45] <ceil420> Arelis, why on earth would you want to do that?
[06:45] <dupin> Tjh__ : I don´t think so.Check Cd for errors
[06:45] <maco> Arelis: why would we want to?
[06:45] <bod_> ;-)
[06:45] <Tjh__> Arelis: not personally but i have seen examples of it yes
[06:45] <nickrud> B166erx a nice trick is blkid
[06:45] <nks_> Hello, is there a way for me to enable graphics acceleration on a Macbook 2.16 ghz. using ubuntu 8.04 on vmware ?
[06:45] <blankhead> it use to work in gutsy all the time... i press the media button on my keyboard and out pops up banshee (my default multimedia app)
[06:45] <Tjh__> uuuh how to do that in a goood way?
[06:45] <alien> maco: lol .. still i dont think its workign right
[06:46] <maco> nks_: i dont think you can do 3D in a vm
[06:46] <blankhead> is there a place where i could submit a bug for this?
[06:46] <nickrud> nks_ inside vmware? there's experimental stuff for that, but no simple way
[06:46] <B166erx> nickrud ?
[06:46] <maco> alien: whats it doing?
[06:46] <mouseclone> B166erx:  here is my fstab with the /home directory mounted on a different drive http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64642/
[06:46] <Arelis> ceil420: well, if you don't want to buy vista, and don't want to work in vista, and don't have a vista-capable pc :P
[06:46] <bazhang> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 bod_ you seen this?
[06:46] <parkar86> so... if i need to recompile a driver... do i have to recompile the kernel... or can i just get away with recompiling the driver and loading it
[06:46] <dupin> Tjh__ :you will see that option when you boot CD
[06:46] <nks_> wow -LOL-
[06:46] <nickrud> B166erx to find out your hd /dev paths
[06:46] <sls> bod_ yse that does work as any USB drive would... but they are not visible in the ipod. it says "no movies" when infect there are ipod movies there.
[06:46] <EddieDied> please need help, I have school in 1/2 hour and I have homework to print out, how do I restore initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 in ubuntu?
[06:46] <ceil420> Arelis, there are many, MANY themes that look better than Aero...
[06:46] <maco> alien: you should be able to right click it and select compiz or metacity from "select window manager"
[06:46] <Gman99999> nickrud when i tried to add my account as an admin it said it was already in the admin group and then i logged in again and just for fun i checked and once again it says g is not in the sudoes file
[06:46] <bod_> bazhang: oh, it may be because i have a seperate / and/home now?
[06:46] <B166erx> nickrud, yeap,  but it does nothing here
[06:46] <Tjh__> o yes like i said ALL THE OPTIONS TURN UP THE ERROR
[06:46] <maco> alien: should also be able to open the settings manager from it
[06:46] <Arelis> ceil420: would you give me an example, please?
[06:46] <bazhang> nks_: nay, parallels may have some basic gfx though (paid for not free)
[06:46] <Tjh__> and i mean ALL
[06:46] <ceil420> Arelis, if you go for "exactly like Vista", you're like, a wannabe Vista-user. and that's worse than an actual Vista-user.
[06:47] <ceil420> Arelis, www.gnome-look.org
[06:47] <maco> alien: i didnt write it by the way...just pulled a snapshot from svn and compiled it
[06:47] <parkar86> lol
[06:47] <bod_> bazhang: no but il try it now if you thinkit will help
[06:47] <Tjh__> well except it gets into the wubi fine
[06:47] <bazhang> bod_: should do
[06:47] <maco> alien: so i dont know how it works, just how to use it
[06:47] <EddieDied> even a hint?
[06:47] <dupin> Tjh__ : can you burn it on lower speed
[06:47] <bod_> bazhang: kk, back in a bit
[06:47] <parkar86> any help of recompiling drivers
[06:47] <parkar86> ?
[06:47] <nickrud> B166erx one of the 'bugs', use sudo blkid (it changed)
[06:47] <EddieDied> anyone?
[06:47] <mouseclone> B166erx: df in console you should be able to see the /dev/sda1
[06:47] <zeeeee> hi, after upgrading from 7.10 to 8.04, typing in filenames doesn't take me to the file anymore in nautilus or the open file dialog... did this get disabled? can i enable it?
[06:47] <Jarryd> hey
[06:47] <Arelis> ceil420: well most of those themes.. i don't like 'em
[06:47] <LSG> ceil420 Maybe Arelis just likes how Vista looks like?
[06:47] <nks_> so there a link for me to test the experimental ?
[06:47] <Arelis> ceil420: i mean, the most on the frontpage (highest rating)
[06:47] <Tjh__> dupin: i burnt it at 10 do i need lower?
[06:48] <sls> is there a program that actually will sync movies to my ipod in linux?
[06:48] <ceil420> Arelis, so use search terms to find something you do like
[06:48] <Jarryd> burn it at as lower speed as possible
[06:48] <EddieDied> is anyone here helping users with ubuntu?
[06:48] <brent113> Arelis, look at the community emerald theme, it's what I use
[06:48] <Jarryd> um
[06:48] <B166erx> nicee
[06:48] <B166erx> thx
[06:48] <amirman84> hi, is kpowersave a good app? is it safe to install? as a KDE app will it mess with GNOME?
[06:48] <maco> Arelis: lets start with "what do you like"?
[06:48] <maco> brent113: emerald is not supported
[06:48] <dupin> Tjh__ If you can yes
[06:48] <Jarryd> I am a nub
[06:48] <bazhang> sls: you can try gtkpod
[06:48] <m1dn1ght> Nickrud: when I logged back in I got a window informing me I was in low graphics mode and giving me the option to configure my display.  I chose sis from the list, but when I run test the screen flickered, a green bar apeared momentarily and then it said configuration had failed
[06:48] <ceil420> LSG, s/he didn't say "similar to Vista", it apparently has to look "EXACTLY like Vista". that's not being a fan of the theme, that's being a poser for the OS.
[06:48] <maco> brent113: the compiz team doesnt even support it.
[06:48] <alien> maco:  lol
[06:48] <Jarryd> I burnt a copy using my laptop burner. Fail.
[06:48] <maco> Arelis: dont use emerald. its crashy
[06:48] <brent113> maco: then why am I using it?
[06:48] <bazhang> EddieDied: not on your time deadline no
[06:48] <sls> bazhang, I have but it is so not obvious... Pointers?
[06:48] <maco> brent113: because you put up with it?
[06:49] <EddieDied> all I want is how to restore initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 in ubuntu.
[06:49] <Arelis> maco: I like a theme that belongs to the genre Fantasy.
[06:49] <brent113> I've never had it crash ever
[06:49] <Arelis> maco: I do not like all the industrial and metal and plastic stuff
[06:49] <Tjh__> hmm will try that then
[06:49] <maco> brent113: i have it installed too, but it crashes all the tim so i stopped using it.  on nvidia it slows everything down.  compiz team said they dont support it and *might* replace it, but the code base will be totally scrapped
[06:49] <Tjh__> o god that will take long
[06:49] <nks_> oooppppssss- I mean--is there a link available for me to test the experimental to get the graphics acceleration working, for the vmware + mac + ubuntu 8.04?
[06:49] <LSG> ceil420: Haha...well maybe you're right.
[06:49] <nickrud> Gman99999 put a copy of your /etc/sudoers file on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org . You are probably going to have to boot back into recovery mode and enable the root account for a while, to aid troubleshooting.   do  passwd <password> in recovery mode, then type exit to get back to the gui. Then you can read /etc/sudoers and pastebin it.
[06:49] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: I think it's part of linux-image-$(uname -r)
[06:49] <bazhang> sls the ubuntu wiki has a link for the iPhone and iPod-->you on gutsy or hardy
[06:49] <brent113> maco: I'm sorry for the experience you've had, but I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with it.
[06:49] <ceil420> :p
[06:49] <LSG> Arelis: Glassy then!
[06:49] <ceil420> now then
[06:49] <AdemoS> So, 7.10 can see and connect to all wifi networks in my house. But 8.04 cannot SEE any wifi networks...? Ubuntu Studio 8.04 seems to be missing gnome-network-manager entirely....What is going on with Hardy? I was told it was the STABLE SOLID release, but I had better luck with Gutsy, which was supposedly more "expiremental...."
[06:50] <achandrashekar> allright after solving a not being able to sudo because of edited host file, and vmware workstation blowing up, I have 8.04 "functioning". However, when I have my brick lugged into my laptop, i get a strange acpi error..any ideas on what this ?
[06:50] <ceil420> how can i tell if a file is a link?
[06:50] <mouseclone> I like the "main menu" it saves some space on the bar, and is like the start or K menu
[06:50] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: and how do I install that?
[06:50] <media64> hey, i just installed Ubuntu 8.04, and my screen res is fucked up
[06:50] <maco> brent113: on which ubuntu and with which drivers?
[06:50] <sls> bazhang, Im on hardy.
[06:50] <amirman84> will kpowersave mess with GNOME?
[06:50] <EddieDied> I have just that file missing in /boot/
[06:50] <dupin> Tjh__ :or you can download same iso with torrent and point download to the folder with existin iso.That way torent will check your iso for errors and replace bad file with good ones
[06:50] <nickrud> Gman99999 when you're done, do sudo passwd -l root , to disable the root login again.
[06:50] <Jarryd> um, when i attempt to load it up, it jams on "Loading Linux Kernel 100%"
[06:50] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: with apt-get install
[06:50] <Arelis> LSG: or wooden..
[06:50] <brent113> maco: hardy, nvidia-glx-new
[06:50] <nickrud> m1dn1ght not sure then. I've never used the sis chip. Let me do a little googling
[06:50] <Tjh__> hmm interesting
[06:50] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: im on a livecd, how will that work?
[06:50] <Tjh__> yes...
[06:50] <LSG> Arelis: Or paper...y..
[06:50] <MEtaLpREs_> ugg... well so far atleast for me Hard y is total crap and it looks like im going back to gutsy
[06:50] <EddieDied> I cant boot in ubuntu
[06:50] <m1dn1ght> thanks nickrud!  I really appreciate the help.
[06:50] <media64> i already installed the drivers, it actually reduced my res from 800x600 to 640x480
[06:51] <bazhang> sls search term should be ubuntu hardy iPhone and that leads directly to the wiki link for both iPhones and iPods
[06:51] <kunzy> Can anyone help me with a GRUB Error 17
[06:51] <media64> and i have absolutely no Linux experience
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: cant you pull it off the CD?
[06:51] <cfreeze> on a postmordem of a ubuntu install (aka DOA hardy install), what would be the best way of pulling what packages were installed?  I know on a live system I can do dpkg --get-selections, but on a dead one..
[06:51] <Jarryd> Hey EddieDied -- Burn it at a low speed on a real burner. Not laptop
[06:51] <dupin> MEtaLpREs_ :every new release need polish
[06:51] <EddieDied> Tjh__: uhh and just copy it?
[06:51] <sls> bazhang, ok
[06:51] <yuri_> how do i get the description of a package i have yet to install through the commandline? something like apt-cache desc package?
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: mkinitcpio
[06:51] <B166erx> mouseclone , hm, the UUID, i add it manually, but hm,    is it the same that sudo blkid gives me ?
[06:51] <maco> brent113: it crashes on my intel on hardy....worked fine-ish on gutsy & feisty (only a little crashy...not any more than beryl was).  on my friend's nvidia it just turned the whole system slow.  #compiz-fusion said to get rid of emerald because they wont be fixing any bugs.  quinn (the one that made beryl) said it's spaghetti code and should go
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: man mkinitcpio
=== deshawn is now known as JewRat
[06:51] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: oh.  In that case, you will need to mount the filesystem to a temporary directory, chroot into it, then run update-initramfs
[06:51] <achandrashekar> btw....for those that are upgrading...vmware will need re-configuring...thats workstation that is..
[06:51] <EddieDied> Jarryd: I had ubuntu running, I just have initrd.img-2.6.24-16-386 deleted from my HD
[06:51] <ceil420> yuri_, apt-cache show packagename
[06:51] <bazhang> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 try this kunzy
[06:51] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: ok thanks will try that
[06:51] <Tjh__> Eddie: or that
[06:51] <Jarryd> oh
[06:51] <maco> brent113: if it works for you, great, but its not being supported upstream at all
[06:51] <LSG> Arelis: You made me want to get a nice theme now
[06:51] <nickrud> m1dn1ght that was a 771/671 , right?
[06:52] <amirman84> does anyone here use KPowersave?
[06:52] <yuri_> ceil420: excellent. ty
[06:52] <Arelis> LSG: heh :P
[06:52] <ceil420> np :)
[06:52] <JewRat> 420 <3
[06:52] <Myrtti> I feel like such a newcomer again. How does one change the display driver in Hardy?
[06:52] <kunzy> bazhang     k, will give it a read
[06:52] <AdemoS> So, 7.10 can see and connect to all wifi networks in my house. But 8.04 cannot SEE any wifi networks...? Ubuntu Studio 8.04 seems to be missing gnome-network-manager entirely....What is going on with Hardy? I was told it was the STABLE SOLID release, but I had better luck with Gutsy, which was supposedly more "expiremental...."
[06:52] <mouseclone> B166erx: the sudo blkid I didn't know about.. but the sudo blkid will list all mount points with respected UUID
[06:52] <Jarryd> fuck. I made progress but Ubuntu is stuck at Loading linux kernal 100%
[06:52] <alien> maco: it works fine but still cant turn it into a ice cube lol
[06:52] <maco> Arelis: by "fantasy" do you just mean for the wallpaper?
[06:52] <bazhang> !language | Jarryd
[06:52] <ubotu> Jarryd: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family friendly.
[06:52] <Arelis> ceil420: I am not a fan of the OS. I don't even like it. It does all kinds of weird things on my dad's laptop, and then he asks me. But i kind of like the look
[06:52] <maco> alien: oh in the settings manager you need to enable cube
[06:52] <brent113> maco: yes I understand that.  Unfortunately several themes I like are only made for emerald.  If there is a way of converting it to a different one I'd do that, but I have not yet found a way
[06:52] <alien> maco: cube i mean
[06:52] <Arelis> maco: GTK theme, usplash, everything
[06:52] <alien> maco: i dide that and reloaded
[06:52] <mouseclone> B166erz: vol_id /dev/sda1 will only like sda1 not all volumes
[06:52] <alien> maco: still nothing
[06:52] <nickrud> Myrtti you can still put it in xorg.conf I think.
[06:53] <maco> alien: did you enable cube rotate?
[06:53] <media64> can anyone help my res problem? i tried installing the restricted driver but it only made my problem worse
[06:53] <lopin> I'm having a problem with the upgrade tool locking up?
[06:53] <Myrtti> ok, let's try that
[06:53] <ceil420> Arelis, right down to the Vista "Start" button?
[06:53] <Gman99999> nickrud ok so with this command  passwd <password> in the command line in recovery mode will set everything in super user mode even if i reboot back into this account?
[06:53] <maco> Arelis: how do you do a fantasy gtk theme?
[06:53] <Arelis> ceil420: no, that thing's clusmy and unhandy to me
[06:53] <alien> maco: yes
[06:53] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: /usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/udev: 61: cannot create /dev/null: Permission denied  is this normal?
[06:53] <Arelis> maco: hmm..
[06:53] <maco> Arelis: gtk is just the colors of everything
[06:53] <Crshman> hey all, when i click "1" on my number pad on the keyboard linux logs me out...where can i change that?
[06:53] <EddieDied> I got a tonne of those
[06:53] <ekontsevoy> Hm... weird. I am doing sudo apt-get distupgrade on Gutsy (Slicehost) and nothing happens. Isn't it supposed to upgrade to Hardy?
[06:53] <bazhang> AdemoS: ubuntustudio is the problem; nothing to do with hardy and whatnot-->it is completely OSS so will not have certain drivers etc
[06:53] <ceil420> Arelis, then you're not looking for "exactly like Vista", and shouldn't have worded your request like that :p
[06:53] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: did you chroot into the temporary directory?
[06:53] <Arelis> maco: http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Everwood?content=61330 <-- This goes somewhat close
[06:53] <kunzy> bazhang:   I am going offline to test.   Asume no news is good news.   Thanks!!!!
[06:53] <Jarryd> kernal panic lol
[06:53] <s_> nor wired nor wireless internet connection in 8.04..dissapointment
[06:53] <nickrud> Gman99999 no, that means you can do   su - root in the terminal, and have access to the stuff you do in the recovery console
[06:54] <Gman99999> ok
[06:54] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: yes sudo chroot /media/disk su
[06:54] <amirman84> kpowersave anybody? or maybe somebody has suggestions for fixing my hibernation on my dell e1505 using hardy?
[06:54] <brent113> ekontsevoy, If you open update-manager and click the Check button, does it show you there is an upgrade available?
[06:54] <alien> maco:  any idea?
[06:54] <alien> maco: cube and rotate cube i enabled reloaded
[06:54] <ekontsevoy> brent113: I am on a comnand-line system
[06:54] <achandrashekar> media: im not sure if there is a backup file if you upgraded or not.. but may be checking /etc/X11 and the xorg.conf
[06:54] <alien> maco: everything still seems to be same
[06:54] <maco> Arelis: the wallpaper's the only thing fantasy about that...
[06:54] <s_> i returned to 7.10
[06:54] <Cynic_AU> hey guys, my 8.04 boots into BusyBox. Any tips for troubleshooting from here..?
[06:54] <maco> alien: hold down ctrl alt and click and drag your mouse...anything happen?
[06:54] <Jarryd> I am running a Live CD. How long is  a normal bootup time? core2 duo 1.8, 4gb ram
[06:54] <juan> hi I have a problem after updating to 8.04
[06:54] <ceil420> Cynic_AU, is that a window manager?
[06:54] <EddieDied> and I got this too /usr/sbin/mkinitramfs: 186: cannot create /dev/null: Permission denied
[06:54] <media64> okay ﻿achandrashekar: i have NO idea about anything in linux, i just installed it 10 minutes ago
[06:54] <alien> maco: lol yeah hehe
[06:55] <bazhang> AdemoS: the best way to go is to enable ubuntustudio repos then add stuff to ubuntu (apps, themes etc)
[06:55] <Crshman> any idea's as to what this error means?? (this is the error i get in /var/log/messages when i click "1") Xgl[13492]: segfault at 000001a6 eip 0818db66 esp bfdc81a0 error 4
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> BusyBox is a minimal shell with a few commands.
[06:55] <Gman99999> nickrud so i do  passwd <password> to get super user access in this account im logged into right now?
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> obviously something fails during startup
[06:55] <Tjh__> Eddie: run as root..
[06:55] <amirman84> :(
[06:55] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: cd /dev then run ./MAKEDEV /dev/null
[06:55] <EddieDied> BUT the file is there
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> gets halfway through startup splash
[06:55] <ceil420> Cynic_AU, ah. i don't know then. i was gonna suggest changing session at the login window <_<
[06:55] <EddieDied> oh ok
[06:55] <Cynic_AU> doesnt get to login window :) thanks anyway
[06:55] <brent113> ekontsevoy, the command to upgrade is sudo update-manager -d.  If that doesn't work.. I don't know
[06:55] <ceil420> i tried :x
[06:55] <crdlb> Crshman: get rid of Xgl
[06:55] <alien> maco: nice but it only shows two sides
[06:55] <B166erx> mouseclone http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64643/  (the 2 last lines) should that do the trick or am i missing something ?
[06:55] <nickrud> Gman99999 after you have enabled the root account in recovery mode, you do:    su - root   (switch user to root) , then type in the password. You are then in sudo mode, until you type exit
[06:56] <alien> maco: if i have 4 windows ..
[06:56] <EddieDied> ./MAKEDEV: don't know how to make device "/dev/null"
[06:56] <Jarryd> How long is a standard boot time?
[06:56] <Sp0tteh> can anyone help me out with mdadm?????
[06:56] <Cynic_AU> Jarryd - depends on hardware. For me - quicker than windows.
[06:56] <ceil420> Jarryd, there isn't a "standard" boot time
[06:56] <juan> After I updated from 7.10 to 8.04 and restart, I can't get the login window, my mouse is busy is there a solution??
[06:56] <achandrashekar> media64: that xorg.conf controls ALOT when dealing with X11 issues...and with the card you have, a google search, may just yield how to edit it properly. I highly suggest a backup of that file though, if you wish to "play with it".In the worse case scenario, you can revert it. do that with a cp xorg.conf to xorg.conf.old.
[06:56] <B166erx> mouseclone (just saw the relatime error, fixed)
[06:56] <maxagaz> how to copy all and only the hidden files and directories of my home/ directory ?
[06:56] <Crshman> crdlb: will compiz still work w/o XGL?
[06:56] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: what about ./MAKEDEV std?
[06:56] <nickrud> Gman99999 the reason you're doing this is you can't read /etc/sudoers except with root privs, either from sudo or from logging in as root
[06:57] <crdlb> Crshman: you might need to make a few changes, but yes it should
[06:57] <media64> where do i find that file?
[06:57] <maxagaz> to another location
[06:57] <maco> alien: in the setting thing, change your horizontal virtual size to 4...in general section
[06:57] <mouseclone> B166erx: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/64644/
[06:57] <Crshman> crdlb: cool thanks
[06:57] <bazhang> media64: this is gutsy or hardy
[06:57] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: ./MAKEDEV: warning: can't read /proc/devices
[06:57] <achandrashekar> mxagaz: thats done with a cp -r for a recursive copy and * as a wildcard
[06:57] <Jarryd> Then does that mean that if i am Jammed on "Loading Linux Kernal 100%" for 5 minutes on a live cd, it is jammed?
[06:57] <mouseclone> B166erx: corrected
[06:57] <Dusk_> hi there
[06:57] <Gman99999> nickrud sorry im just a little confused here how do i enable root access in recovery mode again?
[06:57] <crdlb> Crshman: join #compiz-fusion if compiz doesn't work without Xgl installed
[06:57] <AdemoS> So, 7.10 can see and connect to all wifi networks in my house. But 8.04 cannot SEE any wifi networks...? Ubuntu Studio 8.04 seems to be missing gnome-network-manager entirely....What is going on with Hardy? I was told it was the STABLE SOLID release, but I had better luck with Gutsy, which was supposedly more "expiremental...."
[06:57] <nickrud> m1dn1ght what chips set do you have again?
[06:57] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: try running mount -t proc proc /proc
[06:57] <alien> maco: ok
[06:58] <m1dn1ght> sorry nickrud - missed that last message.  Was an SiS Mirage 3.
[06:58] <bazhang> AdemoS: I just gave you two answers why are you repeating?
[06:58] <JewRat> alien
[06:58] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: then run your previous commands?
[06:58] <alien> JewRat: yes sir
[06:58] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: yes
[06:58] <Gman99999> nickrud so i do su-root in recovery mode as well, im just a tad confused on this part
[06:58] <AdemoS> bazhang, sorry didn't see before
=== paijo is now known as punk
[06:58] <bazhang> AdemoS: scroll up to see
[06:58] <nickrud> Gman99999 when you see the command prompt, just type    passwd <rootpassword>
[06:58] <shulman> I just upgraded to Hardy and am attempting to use Ubuntu with the nvidia driver-- I'm able to use both screens, but gnome seems to be treating both screens as seperate entities -- I can move the mouse between them but I can't move windows between them. Any idea how I can fix this?
[06:58] <nickrud> Gman99999 not needed, you're already root in recovery :)
[06:58] <m1dn1ght> messages don't stay on the screen long when you're in 800x600!  :D
[06:58] <Radtoo^laptop> AdemoS: Take it easy... read the answers... breathe deeply... and be a bit tolerant, this is complex stuff :)
[06:58] <AdemoS> bazhang, I tried both Ubuntu Studio and Ubuntu desktop, same exact issue
[06:58] <Eleaf> Is it possible to give pulseaudio a higher priority?  It skips so much when doing processor-intensive things or just doing lots of scrolling (while alsa won't skip alone)...?
[06:58] <media64> i have a 7900 nVidia graphics card, i dont know too much about it other than it has 1 Gb of vram
[06:58] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: ok ./MAKEDEV std came to a new line
[06:58] <nickrud> m1dn1ght the chip numbers, 761/771 ? was that right?
[06:58] <achandrashekar> anyone experiencing strange acpi issues...when plugging in power to a laptop on boot? my systems ocassionally hangs and complains of it.
[06:59] <EddieDied> Starnestommy: when I did the /dev/null one, I still get ./MAKEDEV: don't know how to make device "/dev/null"
[06:59] <Starnestommy> EddieDied: does /dev/null exist?
