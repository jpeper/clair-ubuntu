[21:39] <cnf> xkernel: i use TOTP myself
[21:40] <cnf> xkernel: but it's just pam configuration

[21:41] <cnf> xkernel: what from that article isn't working?
[21:41] <UBlondie> ...I was also able to edit the contents of the file using gedit by the way ...so in that context it seems 'writable'
[21:41] <DiegoNolan> well can i change my keyboard to programmer dvorak via cmomand line, else i'm going to take 5 days to back these files up in qwerty
[21:41] <xkernel> cnf, didn't try it yet but I see it's identifies a USB device S/N and UUID to authenticate it
[21:41] <cnf> yes...
[21:42] <xkernel> cnf, this can be easily evade by a microcontroller  or fake device,  I'm looking for something that fetches certificate from the USB
[21:43] <cnf> why? i think it's kinda stupid anyway
[21:43] <cnf> 1)  physical access means it is too late, really, anyway
[21:43] <cnf> it's far easier booting from usb than faking usb ID's
[21:43] <cnf> 2) doesn't work remote
[21:43] <cnf> 3) TOTP is FAR easier, and works remote
[21:44] <servvs> okay so i made the terrible decision today to upgrade to 13.04, I have to revert to the live disc because I am not able to use internet and my video looks terrible, my resolution is way down. Is this a common issue with 13.04 not installing the proper drivers?
[21:45] <cnf> xkernel: and 4) TOTP has to be authed every time, so it is secure remote as well
[21:45] <OerHeks> m1chael, read after #35, the issue is solved, it was a bios update, not a wpa issue, so it will be available tru updated atheros  i guess, else be patient.
[21:45] <cnf> xkernel: so my main question would be, what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[21:47] <xkernel> cnf, like I said in the beginning; authentication with device as well as password like https://www.hidglobal.com/products/cards-and-credentials/identity-assurance/usb-tokens
[21:48] <cnf> xkernel: those work by generating OTP
[21:48] <cnf> not by having "a certificate"
[21:49] <cnf> xkernel: do you have a smartphone?
[21:49] <xkernel> cnf, not currently
[21:49] <xkernel> cnf but will get one, what the solution you want to say??
[21:49] <cnf> xkernel: TOTP (Time based One Time Password)
[21:50] <cnf> smart phone generates a token, that is valid for 30 seconds, and one time use
[21:50] <cnf> it's what my servers have
[21:50] <xkernel> cnf,  which application will be installed on the smart phone to generate the password???
[21:50] <cnf> several can do it
[21:50] <cnf> the google authenticator app for iOS and android does it, but i prefer the Duo Security app on iOS or android myself
[21:51] <cnf> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile for android
[21:51] <cnf> https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/duo-mobile/id422663827?mt=8 for ios
[21:51] <cnf> there is a blackberry one as well
[21:51] <OerHeks> i use yubikey, but those systems rely on internet.
[21:51] <xkernel> cnf, is it secure enough to synchronize google authenticator app with the server? I mean is there any chance that another app match mine?
[21:51] <cnf> xkernel: it also secures my VPN
[21:51]  * dogbert2 kicks VBox right in da junk
[21:52] <cnf> xkernel: there is no synchronize
[21:52] <bazhang> dogbert2, stop that
[21:52] <cnf> xkernel: google has nothing to do with it
[21:52] <cnf> xkernel: it's just their app you use
[21:52] <cnf> OerHeks: i use Duo services, but yeah it needs internet
[21:52] <cnf> OerHeks: you can use the yubi key offline, if you know the key secret, though
[21:52] <tf201> hi
[21:52] <cnf> don how open they are
[21:53] <OerHeks> well, i can run my own auth,
[21:53] <cnf> yah
[21:53] <cnf> xkernel: the TOTP is a well documented standard

[22:18] <kristenbb> hi, I'm having a problem logging into my computer. I have ubuntu 1204. I am 100% sure I didn't change my password, but I tried typing it 100 times, it's not working. I restarted the computer, I made sure I didn't have caps on or that the layout didn't change, I even tried logging in with ssh, but the password seems to have been changed. I am the only one using my computer. What can I do ?
[22:18] <bekks> kristenbb: Boot a livecd, and reset your password.
[22:19] <[FreeBSD]> kristenbb: try chrooting and using passwd command
[22:19] <kristenbb> bekks: my drive is encrypted.
[22:19] <bekks> kristenbb: Then you have to boot a livecd, decrypt your drive, and reset your password.
[22:20] <kristenbb> bekks: ok. Could you please detail the steps to decrypt it ?
[22:20] <bekks> kristenbb: I have no clue, since I am not using decryption myself due to lack of reasons for encryption :)
[22:21] <kristenbb> I just checked 'encrypt home drive' when installing ubuntu, I didn't do anything special.
[22:21] <bekks> kristenbb: Then you dont even need to decrypt it.
[22:21] <bekks> kristenbb: The password hash isnt stored in your home.

[22:23] <BillJobs> hey guys I have an old acer machine with windows 8 on it was thinking of doing a clean install of Ubuntu on it. Which version of Ubuntu should I go with & should I do 32 bit or 64? I think it has a dual core with only 3gb of ram.
[22:23] <redlance> So...knowing how important it is to backup my stuff, I'm wondering how to back up my file server.  I know how to backup my data...but I want to backup all the configuration changes that I've made to Samba, Apache, Plex server, and my Squeezebox.  Is there a program to do this for me?  Will I run into trouble if I upgrade the OS, and then reinstall those 4 servers, and try to use my old config files?
[22:24] <K1lleD> BillJobs:  what processor have this laptop. and with 3gb ram, i think 12.04 LTS, or 12.10
[22:25] <bekks> BillJobs: If it is capable of 64bit, I'd go with that.

[22:33] <kristenbb> yes
[22:33] <ToBeFree> I assume you need your password to decrypt it; if it would be possible to change the password of any encryption, that encryption would be useless
[22:33] <ToBeFree> so it won't damage it, I assume, but it wouldn't give you any access

[22:54] <mong> AndroUser: sorry, skype and uefi are both out of my comfort zone
[22:54] <Marcello> jrib: Do you know how to help me with this?
[22:54] <chvx> seronis: why are there other partition schemes?
[22:54] <AndroUser> Ok
[22:54] <jrib> Marcello: no, only what's in the wiki link about wireless
=== racedo` is now known as racedo
[22:55] <seronis> chvx: historical reasons for when upgrades didnt go as smoothly as they do today so that peoples /home directories were more secure between reinstllations
[22:56] <Marcello> jrib: I tried that already and it didn't work. Not only was it unclear but it was also filled with broken links to important downloads that they "said" would fix the problem.
[22:56] <jrib> kristenbb: I doubt that would happen.  But you can reset the password like I said.  If you want to just try mounting the encrypted partition directly (like from a live cd), you can « /msg ubottu encrption » for instructions
[22:56] <harris> hi
[22:56] <seronis> chvx: for administrative types who like to switch between distroes and have simultaneous installs.  basically for  'not your average user' type uses
[22:56] <Darkchaos> May a blinking Cursor while booting from USB indicate a damaged mbr?
[22:56] <jrib> Marcello: last I checked there was the broadcom sta driver available from "hardware drivers" or whatever it's called now.  That's all I know.  Works fine on my macbook
[22:57] <chvx> seronis: how about swap, i heard that you should partition it twice your RAM right?
[22:57] <Marcello> jrib: Thanks for the help, I'll check it out. (ps. is typing someones name followed by a colon the way you ping somebody?)
[22:58] <bekks> chvx: Thats wrong.
[22:58] <bekks> chvx: Thats was a rule, around 20 years ago.
[22:58] <chvx> bekks: haha ok :D
[22:58] <jrib> Marcello: most clients will highlight your own nick, so including a persons name will tend to grab their attention
[22:58] <bekks> chvx: Nowadays, you need 1x RAM = SWAP for hibernation.
[22:58] <elky> Marcello, or a , but tab completion will append that automatically. if your first choice doesn't appear when you tab complete, hit tab another time and it'll give you other options
[22:59] <chvx> bekks: 1x?
[22:59] <seronis> chvx: instead of 2x
