[10:42] <MaRk-I> azlon1: on the remote machine I mean
[10:42] <PythonPup> NightKhaos, I usually write Python scripts, not bash scripts, so I did not notice the error.
[10:43] <azlon1> MaRk-I: on the client? the client is running windows 7...
[10:43] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: figures, with the name and all.
[10:43] <PythonPup> alsem, How would I do that, alsem?
[10:43] <MaRk-I> azlon1: ah nvm then
[10:43] <rocket16> Hello all
[10:43] <PythonPup> NightKhaos, That is a pretty good clue.  I was putting together a spin of Puppy Linux with Python added.  Thence, this nickname.

[10:47] <PythonPup> azlon1, probably.  Look at gconf and see if there is a key to control it.  You can script changing those.
[10:47] <ShapeShifter499> MaRk-I beat me to it
[10:47] <ShapeShifter499> xD
[10:47] <NightKhaos> PythonPup: hehe, I'm getting quite good at doing inline for loops. It freaks a couple of people out cause they tend to be like "wtf did you just do?"... to quote a friend of mine "my shell foo is strong"
[10:47] <PythonPup> NightKhaos, That is a handy skill.
[10:48] <zhang> my English is very poor
[10:48] <rocket16> zhang: No problem, we all can understand you well, :)
[10:48] <PythonPup> azlon1, the program gconftool-2 is what you would call in such a script.
[10:48] <zhang> thank you
[10:48] <ShapeShifter499> zhang: your fine

[11:40] <k0sh> TiK: what?
[11:40] <Minas1> ok
[11:40] <bibo> hiddenpearls: It takes a long time depending on your computer. Just wait a while and then you should be able to install it (~15 minutes max I've had for an old computer)
[11:40] <TiK> k0sh: cd into the dir you want to compress or the one before it
[11:40] <justin22885> well everyone... i made the neccessary FSTAB changes, and tweaked ext4 for running on a USB drive

[11:41] <MaRk-I> demoneye: S3 VIA cards are how can I say it barely supported and tricky you can reconfigure your X but might leave you without it if you dont do it right
[11:41] <TiK> k0sh: cd /home/me/NetBeansProjects/ && tar cvfz test.tar.gz test
[11:41] <bibo> hiddenpearls: How long did you wait? It takes a while, but once it's installled it's very fast
[11:41] <hiddenpearls> bibo: not asking any option just loading with background
[11:41] <justin22885> theres actually an immediate change in performance, EASILY noticed
[11:41] <vak> Kino captures DV-video OK, but exports(encodes) it into ugly interlaced video. Did anyone successfully cope with it?.. Does de-interlacing really work in Kino?...
[11:41] <k0sh> TiK: how does it relate to pxebooting???
[11:42] <TiK> eeer
[11:42] <TiK> i ment bavbat
[11:42] <hiddenpearls> bibo: it took 2 hours
[11:42] <k0sh> lol

[11:42] <k0sh> :D
[11:42] <k0sh> k, np
[11:42] <pyost> bibo: well, it doesn't seem to be that common, since I couldn't google a solution - to cut a long story short, I had to cancel a burning task in Brasero because it got stuck, and now the drive is dead in both ubuntu and windows
[11:42] <TiK> :D
[11:42] <fredfall> When does alpha 3 come?
[11:42] <demoneye> MaRk-I: oh ok
[11:42] <hiddenpearls> bibo: I was giving it a try from USB and CD
[11:42] <bibo> hiddenpearls: You may have a bad burn. Try burning the .iso on the slowest speed possible. I've had that issue before.

[11:44] <k0sh> why o why when i PXEBOOT my ubuntu it tells me that it didnt found /lib/modules/2.6.32-21generic/modules.dep even tho that file exists in nfs exported dir, plus other distros netboot just fine, only ubuntu gives me such error and goes into kernel panic, dir is exported via nfs v3
[11:44] <bibo> hiddenpearls: what's your hardware? It may be incompatible. Also you may just have had a bad bootup. I had that with Lubuntu, but then I tried again and it worked
[11:44] <bibo> *may not be compatible

[11:45] <hiddenpearls> bibo: you know what , when I install it from USB/CD it starts copying in C: drive
[11:45] <bibo> hiddenpearls: ???
[11:45] <demoneye> MaRk-I: sure looks confusing, I will, thank you :)
[11:46] <hiddenpearls> bibo: and after copying, it starts downloading from torrent
[11:46] <aswin> we write c programs like a chat system,retreving date nd time etc etc
[11:46] <justin22885> hey everyone
[11:46] <bibo> hiddenpearls: Are you doing a Wubi install?
[11:46] <hiddenpearls> bibo: Yes
[11:46] <hiddenpearls> wubi.exe is there
[11:47] <vak> is any one here experienced with miniDV video encoding?
[11:47] <bibo> hiddenpearls: Are you trying to run it by clicking on Wubi?
[11:47] <justin22885> im noticing an immediate change in performance when i tweaked fstab to run ext4 on my USB flash drive...
[11:47] <hiddenpearls> bibo: Yes
[11:48] <MaRk-I> demoneye: on the 2nd link read post #3   that looks like it might help
[11:48] <justin22885> its running faster, smoother, and optimized to write as little as neccessary to the actual drive
[11:48] <hiddenpearls> bibo: and then I tried both options demo and install inside windows
[11:50] <bibo> hiddenpearls: you could try setting it up as a dual boot
[11:50] <hiddenpearls> bibo: how to set it dual boot ?
[11:51] <bibo> hiddenpearls: First I have to ask, do you have a backup of Win7?
[11:51] <hiddenpearls> bibo: no
[11:51] <justin22885> first step is to load a liveCD, "tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback /dev/sdx1", then under fstab i used "/dev/sdx1 / ext4 noatime,nodiratime,data=writeback,nobh 0 0"
[11:52] <justin22885> then also under fstab added /var/log, /tmp, and /var/tmp to operate under tmpfs
[11:52] <hiddenpearls> bibo: I can try this on my other PC
[11:52] <hiddenpearls> bibo: which have winxp
[11:52] <leon> dd
=== leon is now known as Guest90501
[11:52] <hiddenpearls> bibo: though I have tried this there too but damn the same situation
[11:53] <hiddenpearls> bibo: it starts loading with background and continues forever
[11:53] <bibo> hiddenpearls: wubi is known to have problems, you could try reinstalling it, or to set up as a dual boot just put the live cd in the tray, shut down the system, and turn it back on, and it'll boot into the disk. Then there will be an option to easily create a partition for Ubuntu.
[11:53] <Guest90501> anybody hear
[11:54] <hiddenpearls> bibo: wubi extracts when I make ISO readable via magicISO
[11:54] <hiddenpearls> or form USB
[11:54] <arzhar> whats the name for png library ? libpng12-dev ?
[11:55] <waltercool> libpng?
[11:55] <hiddenpearls> bibo: partition is necassary to create ?
[11:55] <ramontayag> hey guys. would anyone know why a windows share asks for a password when viewing via ubuntu, and it doesn't ask for a password when i'm viewing via another windows machine? i tried entering no password, my the guest's password, but it doesn't let me though.
[11:55] <bibo> arzhar: libpng, it should be installed by default
[11:55] <matrix> Hello guys
[11:55] <matrix> i cant use some icons theme on my ubuntu

[11:55] <hiddenpearls> bibo: for ubuntu
[11:55] <waltercool> arzhar, are you developing something with libpng or you need it for an app?
[11:55] <lunavorax> Why is the line "force_color_prompt=yes" is commented in the .bashrc file ?
[11:55] <matrix> my ubuntu cant use some art icons theme
[11:56] <arzhar> bibo: it is, but trying to compile E gives me this Check if Evas was compiled with png module enabled and all required dependencies exist.
[11:56] <bibo> matrix: I've had that same issue. Go to gnome-look.org and there's several icon sets that actually do work
[11:56] <Laggie> I have some strange problems with the nano editor, the text is moved visibly one line too high, so when I start editing I edit the wrong line. To see the correct text on the line I need to use the right arrow key and punch through all text that I want to see correct first.

[11:58] <aronaliaga> el chat en español
[11:58] <bibo> hiddenpearls: Well if you're dual booting, Ubuntu needs part of a harddrive specifically for itself. I don't know much about Wubi, I couldn't get it to work so I just dual booted.
[11:58] <aronaliaga> alguien me ayuda?
[11:59] <aronaliaga> q ocurre?
[11:59] <io> !es | aronaliaga
[11:59] <ubottu> aronaliaga: En la mayoría de canales de Ubuntu se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español o charlar entra en el canal #ubuntu-es. Escribe "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y dale a enter.
[11:59] <MaRk-I> demoneye: next step is to restart X,   just log out and back in
