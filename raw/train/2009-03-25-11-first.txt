[10:34] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:does this have to do something with the history of installation of nvidia?i mean, i think i used a bad method of shutting down server(which neednt require that terminal scree)
[10:34] <fliegenderfrosch> azlon: are you looking for something like "scim"?
[10:34] <azlon> fliegenderfrosch: I don't know... let me google SCIM real quick...
[10:34] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: nope that is imho not the point
[10:35] <fliegenderfrosch> azlon: i don’t know more about it unfortunately, is I have no use for it myself

[10:35] <remoteCTRL1> shay26: to my computer
[10:35] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:i used some rm   to shut down x server from terminal, then installed lib6 libraries, and then nvidia file

[11:51] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: classic
[11:52] <Lint02> yinlong: I'm afraid not
[11:52] <remoteCTRL1> Pici: whats the point in that if i have been communicating with him like for 1,5 hours and exchange some 3 sentences in german?;)
[11:52] <yinlong> Lint02,can you explain to me ?
[11:52] <nightclaw> remoteCTRL1 http://nopaste.at/1ed8f1ec43
[11:53] <Lint02> yinlong: I don't know
[11:53] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: unfortunately i have to say that among the ca. 15 computers that i service with ubuntu on NOT ONE SINGLE ONE could be updated without some major issues...
[11:53] <yinlong> oh,not at all
[11:53] <yinlong> Lint02
[11:54] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: ya that is really weird...

[11:55] <kenneth_> ubottu, graphics
[11:55] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about graphics
[11:55] <blip-> where can I find the equivalent logs to /var/adm/messages and /var/adm/sulogs under ubuntu ?  thanks
[11:55] <remoteCTRL1> Pici: maybe you would like to help us; he cant upgrade the pidgin version, phunny thing is he tried to purge it, ubuntu says it is not installed but he can run it
[11:55] <kenneth_> ubottu, Graphics?
[11:55] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about Graphics?
[11:55] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: purged
[11:55] <nightclaw> nice
[11:55] <kenneth_> anybody here know anything about compiz issues or should i check another channel?
[11:56] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: do sudo apt-get install -f
[11:56] <durt> yinlong, http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/10/08/how-to-install-ubuntu-locally-over-the-network/
[11:56] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: does ths finish without any action or does it install/remove something?
[11:56] <clusty> hey. is there a way to see which process is hogging all the I/O bandwidth ? (something like a per process iostat) ?
[11:57] <kenneth_> ubottu, compiz?
[11:57] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about compiz?
[11:57] <nightclaw> it suggests autoremove for several packages
[11:57] <nightclaw> libpurple being in the list
[11:57] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: autoremove... well thats not the point...
[11:57] <remoteCTRL1> libpurple?
[11:57] <nightclaw> libpurple-bin to be precise
[11:57] <kenneth_> compiz not loading as default. How to make it load?
[11:57] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: ok in that case sudp apt-get autoremove
[11:58] <remoteCTRL1> nightclaw: libpurple is part of pidgin as far as i recall..
[11:58] <kenneth_> exit
[11:58] <ohletmeinnowjesu> hi guys
[11:59] <hummahumma> remoteCTRL1:hey how do i get permission to edit a file /etc/bash.bashrc? i need to edit this for proxy
[11:59] <nightclaw> yes it is indeed
[11:59] <ohletmeinnowjesu> so heres a seemingly stupid question
[11:59] <remoteCTRL1> hummahumma: sudo gedit <file>
[11:59] <ohletmeinnowjesu> does the ext3 fs get fragmented?
[11:59] <ohletmeinnowjesu> if not, why?
[11:59] <remoteCTRL1> !fragmentation
[11:59] <ubottu> Sorry, I don't know anything about fragmentation
[11:59] <nightclaw> remoteCTRL1 going down for reboot, brb
