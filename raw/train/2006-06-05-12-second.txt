[12:37] <OrTigaS> hi! why when i try to copy my file from Desktop to fat32 hd it said "no permission" to copy
[12:37] <orbin> in azureus, what do the numbers in brackets mean for seeds and peers?
[12:37] <avis> that would be a fstab problem i believe
[12:37] <holycow> Toma-, i'm trying to figure out why my sound is gone, but modules are loaded, sound card is recognized and nothing is muted ... :/
[12:37] <bjmg> On the website https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue1 you can read that there are updates for epihany-browser and other packages (section Ubuntu 6.06 LTS Updates). But they are not available on the mirrors (at least not in binary form). The source packages do exist.
[12:38] <holycow> avis, *nod*, okay that is actually already installed *nod*
[12:38] <avis> you can remove it from fstab and manually mount it
[12:38] <avis> ok

[12:39] <holycow> Toma-, yeah, they worked just before the dist-upgrade infact with last weeks beta.  the weird thing is this  upgrade seems to have updated the kernel, i had to fix nvidia manually and its probably interfering with sound now too
[12:39] <avis> speakers on and plugged in ?  right click volume control and go to the sound level adjustments and or mute panel ?

[12:40] <avis> ubuntuforums.org is awesome.  it gets so much traffic my posts get outdated pretty quick with the new dapper release.  no one replies !
[12:41] <avis> but to some quetions they wont be ignored
[12:41] <holycow> protocol1, well i managed to make the speakers squeal by checking the wrong input box while i had another cardin to test ... i'll try th eother port again, but this one looks green to me ...
[12:41] <Toma-> holycow: im guessing you might have had a modified /etc/modules/aliases file, and the dist-upgrade hasnt installed all the new aliases.
[12:41] <avis> mine was a query for best gnome apps that are unknown
[12:41] <skippy81> i find that the forums arnt good for really technical stuff
[12:41] <nnz0id> when i press i in vi , kinda nothing happens , how to move pointer around

From my first account I switched (with the switch user button) to the normal account. From the normal account I chose log off and there was the problem: The greeter failed to show 6 times. After 6 times a message shows in text mode (very wired characters),...
[12:43] <ubuntuNewbee> ...that tells me that "The display server has been shut down about 6 times in the last 90 seconds. I is likely that something bad is going on. Waiting for 2 minutes before trying again on display :0". After 2 minutes nothing happens.
