[02:52] <james_xxx> i am using a linksys wusb54g v.4 wireless adapter in kubuntu 6.06.1. i have it working, however... my computer occasionally locks up when i am surfing the internet, and i have to reboot. also, if the computer is left idle for a periiod of several hours, it often locks up and has to be rebooted. i do not know if these issues are even connected to the use of this wireless adapter....
[02:52] <swarm_> Does anyone know how to resume a torrent using the lynx torrent system?
[02:52] <profoX`> Sarra_: have you posted it on pastebin.ca
[02:52] <ubuntu> it says fatal server error no screens found
[02:52] <argument> is there any possibility there might be some ROM settings or something getting screwed up? can I flush my network card somehow?
[02:52] <james_xxx> i am looking at an ubuntu forum on the wusb54g wireless adapter (not the one i used to get mine working), and the person who wrote it has blacklisted some modules that i did not blacklist, so i am wondering if that might be an issue?

[02:56] <argument> disastorm, there are methods... you can install it into a 32 bit chroot jail iirc

[02:59] <janubuntu> Flannel how do i do that?
[02:59] <bruenig> swarm_, mininova has a weird setup whereby it wont allow you to download torrents from links. You have to actually go to its page and then click on it. It wants you to visit its site I suppose in  order to gain ad revenues. For instance, if you were to put that link up on another page and click on it. It wouldn't download the torrent it would automatically redirect you to a page where you click on a link to download it. That might
[02:59] <orbin> janubuntu: what xserver-xorg-core version are you running?

[03:12] <Joseph> orbin: if not, how do i mount them at the manual partition screen?
[03:12] <Verithrax> Unfortunately, the new Xorg server crashed irretrievably after that, but going into restore mode and running dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg worked.
[03:12] <eauxnguyen> any ideas on getting sound running on a thinkpad t20? worked using the ubuntu guide fix on 5.10 and now no worky on dapper
[03:12] <tomasz27> does the update applies to a brand new download of the ISO as well?
[03:12] <superjew9020> uhh where do i right clik
=== eyequeue smokes d00by until he reads :)
[03:13] <bruenig> superjew9020, on the file whose default app you want to change
[03:13] <Jordan> How do I just get a .deb file from apt? As in to use on another machine without an internet connection.
[03:13] <eyequeue> superjew9020, places > home filder, for example
[03:13] <orbin> Joseph: i can't say for certain...but i think it should "mount" them for you ... it should have the diagram of partitions on the disk
[03:13] <superjew9020> how do i make xmms my default mp3 player
[03:13] <eyequeue> superjew9020, that app is called nautilus, and any place that is open you can do this

[03:14] <istealyermp3s> O:
[03:14] <eyequeue> superjew9020, click on an mp3, then associate xmms
[03:14] <istealyermp3s> i got quoted!
[03:14] <orbin> superjew9020: in nautilus
[03:14] <superjew9020> will it do that to all of them
[03:14] <istealyermp3s> yes
[03:14] <istealyermp3s> for each extention it does that
[03:14] <janubuntu> BlueEagle just wanted to say i found out what that usb1 is on tha pc
[03:14] <Joseph> orbin: it has a list of the different partitions
[03:14] <istealyermp3s> video files for instance:
[03:14] <Joseph> orbin: and you can select each one and edit it

[03:15] <orbin> Joseph: right...IIRC, when you go to the next step, there are checkboxes saying "format?"
[03:15] <istealyermp3s> i prefer alsamixer

[03:19] <chris__> i built it in /home/chris/local

[03:19] <profoX`> eyequeue: yea i think its because of aoss that people experience problems with firefox+flash
[03:19] <profoX`> eyequeue: i'm going to test more tonight

[03:20] <thompa> i want to backup one dvd, is copy disc to disk image what i want to do?
[03:20] <orbin> chris__: you built xfce from source?
[03:20] <chris__> i used the installer to build it
[03:20] <orbin> why not just grab it from apt?
[03:20] <BlueEagle> john[1] : You're desktop is not "installing"?
[03:20] <bruenig> aoss always made firefox crash when I used it for flash. It allowed me to have flash and another app with sound going at the same time. But after I watched the animation. It always crashed. I did away with it and now it doesn't crash. I can't have the mixing anymore but that is better than crashing
[03:20] <profoX`> sethk: well epiphany worked fine, and i did aoss epiphany, and it crashed like it did on firefox today..

[03:22] <KenSentMe> azathoth: maybe there's an error message in /var/log/syslog

[03:22] <sethk> profoX`, yes, there have been some problems reported with web sites that use the flash plugin
[03:22] <bruenig> chris__, you should have done it via apt
[03:22] <chris__> uhhh i was going after 4.4
[03:22] <sethk> profoX`, I am using KDE so that may also explain why I see different things in some cases
[03:22] <swarm_> ok, btdownloadcurses worked

[03:24] <chris__> according to ubuntuguide.org (which i followed) "    *  finally to enable Xfce, you may need to enable it on the desktop manager (mark allow Xfce manage desktop)"
[03:24] <chris__> not sure what that means lol
[03:24] <Flannel> swarm_: the first 80% mightve been it downloading the torrent file
[03:24] <bruenig> Jordan, doing sudo apt-get -d install whatever, will only download whatever. I don't know where it stores it but it downloads it somewhere
[03:25] <sethk> chris__, that's assuming you installed the package.  you built it, so it's a bit more work than that for gdm to see it
[03:25] <smo> bruenig: most likely /var/cache/apt/archives/
[03:25] <Dev05> Jordan, when you download and intall deb packs, they are in /var/cache/apt/archives.
[03:25] <swarm_> Flannel, nah, it was at 2.8gb of 3.2gb
[03:25] <chris__> whats the apt package to get?
[03:25] <Flannel> chris__: xubuntu-desktop

[03:41] <sethk> Jbirk, no, he needs it with the name gmake, he already has make
[03:41] <Epoch71> i had fglrx installed and it was working fine, i'd rebooted it with those settings a few times
