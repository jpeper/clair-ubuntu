[11:25] <Nosophorus> how do i install totem.thumbnailer in Ubuntu 12.04?
[11:25] <Nosophorus> i mistakenly deleted it
[11:27] <kawkaw> hello, best dist for an asus eepc?
[11:27] <ezra-s> Nosophorus, "apt-cache search totem" find the appropiate package and install it
[11:28] <ezra-s> kawkaw, ubuntu of course
[11:28] <kawkaw> ofcourse but what version`?
[11:28] <ezra-s> any
[11:28] <ezra-s> it really depends on kernel
[11:28] <ezra-s> not distro version
[11:28] <buleeen> thanxx
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> kawkaw: there is no single best
[11:29] <kostkon> !find totem-video-thumbnailer
[11:29] <ubottu> File totem-video-thumbnailer found in totem, totem-common, totem-dbg
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> kawkaw: each distro has advantages and disadvantages
[11:29] <ezra-s> ActionParsnip, there is, here is ubuntu, in debian channel is debian, in arch channel is arch, and so on :P
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> ezra-s: I'd go for tinycore or puppy but Im a bit more versed in Linux than many
[11:30] <kostkon> Nosophorus, locate totem-video-thumbnailer
[11:30] <kawkaw> k
[11:30] <ActionParsnip> !find totem-video-thumbnailer
[11:30] <ezra-s> ActionParsnip, you have to be in their respective channels to promote those choices :P
[11:30] <ubottu> File totem-video-thumbnailer found in totem, totem-common, totem-dbg
[11:30] <kostkon> Nosophorus, http://askubuntu.com/a/115855/1651
[11:30] <Dr_Willis> kawkaw:  xubuntu or lubuntu should work fine on a netbook
[11:30] <ActionParsnip> ezra-s: its not always the 'best' choice though, just because you are in a channel should not sway choices
[11:31] <Dr_Willis> xubuntu works very well on my eee netbook.
[11:31] <ezra-s> ActionParsnip, I know, but it is the same as "which distro is best for..." question, so best reply is to look at the #channel you are in and reply
[11:32] <Dr_Willis> we all know Minix is best ;P
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> ezra-s: i tend to ignore channel, and advise on needs. There were no needs specified so there is no best
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> Dr_Willis: ha
[11:32] <home555> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FsKFaSip1g
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> ezra-s: ask a silly question, an all that6
[11:32] <Nosophorus> kostkon: totem-video-thumbnailer is installed in my machine, it's in /usr/bin/
[11:33] <ezra-s> ActionParsnip, bahhhm you're too serious ;P
[11:33] <kostkon> Nosophorus, but you aren't getting any thumbnails?
[11:34] <Nosophorus> kostkon: yep, i'm not getting any thumbnails here
[11:34] <kostkon> Nosophorus, try clearing the thumbnail cache, http://askubuntu.com/a/2609/1651  logout even after that if you want
[11:36] <Nosophorus> kostkon: ffmpegthumbnailer creates thumbnails for video files, but i don't get any thumbnails for mp3 files
[11:37] <kostkon> Nosophorus, you mean cover art?
[11:38] <Nosophorus> kostkon: yes
[11:38] <Nosophorus> totem.thumbnailer was creating them
[11:38] <Nosophorus> but i mistakenly deleted it
[11:39] <kostkon> Nosophorus, then recreate it, i gave you the answer describing how to do it
[11:40] <kenn_> hi Ubunturs
[11:40] <kostkon> Nosophorus, "I then made a change in /usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer... etc"
[11:40] <kenn_> i can not set sleep time
[11:41] <Nosophorus> kostkon: i'll try that
[11:41] <kostkon> Nosophorus, create the file /usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer and put the three lines mentioned below
[11:41] <kenn_> it sleeps in 5 minutes whatever i set
[11:41] <kostkon> Nosophorus, e.g. sudo nano /usr/share/thumbnailers/totem.thumbnailer
[11:42] <Nosophorus> kostkon: yep, i'm doing that right now
[11:43] <kostkon> Nosophorus, also clear the cache if you haven't done it already and maybe logout and log back in
[11:44] <Nosophorus> kostkon: i'm affraid of doing that because i could lose some thumbnails i like and that were generated by totem.thumbnailer
[11:45] <kostkon> Nosophorus, ok then
[11:45] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, I got a command /dev/hda1  /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g  defaults,exec,fmask=000  0  0
[11:45] <Nosophorus> kostkon: thanks, dude!
[11:45] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, but when I tried mount /dev/sda4 I got
[11:45] <kostkon> Nosophorus, it worked?
[11:45] <Nosophorus> kostkon: it's working flawleslly!!
[11:45] <kostkon> Nosophorus, nice
[11:45] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, fuse: failed to access mountpoint /mnt/windows: No such file or directory
[11:46] <Nosophorus> kostkon: thank you very much! =]
[11:46] <kostkon> Nosophorus, :)
[11:48] <angs> I installed ubuntu via wubi on 20 GB space. Now, I need more space. how can I increase the memory space of ubuntu?
[11:48] <cfhowlett> angs, you do realize wubi is for tESTING not of long-term installation?
[11:49] <cfhowlett> angs, and 20 gigs should be more than adequate.  suggest you look into dual booting
[11:49] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  the mount guides/wiki mention how the mountpoint MUST MUST exist befor you mount to it
[11:49] <Joeyjoeswe> Hi! I am completely new to ubuntu. Trying to install lighttpd at Ubuntu 9.10(I got an reason for using that old one), just getting msg like: "couldnt find  package lighttpd" Hope someone can give me a hint!
[11:49] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  so make the directory
[11:49] <cfhowlett> JoeyJoeJo, end of life means no support here.  use a supported version and ask
[11:49] <Dr_Willis> tbharath:  and i doubt if hda1 is correct for your setup.  most likely its sda1
[11:49] <angs> cfhowlett, what can go wrong if I use wubi in the long term? I have been using wubi for 2 years already
[11:50] <tbharath> Dr_Willis, I changed to sda4
[11:50] <Dr_Willis> angs:  it can break on some trivial upgrade.. and basically its a dead project now
[11:50] <Dudytz> hi all! how the good way to mount two directories (eg. /var and /home) to the related directories in the same other partition? ... eg: sda1 is the root, /var and /home are directories mounted in the sda2 partition (sda2->/var and sda2->/home)
[11:51] <Dr_Willis> !eol | Joeyjoeswe
[11:51] <ubottu> Joeyjoeswe: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[11:51] <cfhowlett> angs, I'm not even going to go into the exhaustive list of what can go wrong.  the wubi developers have stated it's purpose is testing.  using it for something else , like long term installation , is inadvisable at best
