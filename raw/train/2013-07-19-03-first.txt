[02:30] <Wulframn> I'm using xfce
[02:30] <dr_willis> I can see mate and cinnimon vananishing in the near future
[02:30] <Taek> Problem with MATE is.. There don't have enough devs for how many distros they are working on
[02:31] <dr_willis> manpower is always the  limiting factor these days it seems
[02:32] <Taek> Well, they have maybe one dedicated dev per OS/Distro, and a few floaters..
[02:32] <Taek> As awesome as it would be for them to stay up todate with the distros changes, they arn't able to.
[02:32] <dr_willis> its really amazing how few devs are responsible for some of the major apps, and  tools out there.
[02:33] <Taek> hmm, I wonder if I can install irssi-scripts
[02:33] <dr_willis> most of the webcam drivers i hear are done by like a small group of people. 2-3?    with one guy doing most of them
[02:33] <Taek> and use them while irssi is running.
[02:33] <dr_willis> Ive swithed over to weechat in stead of irssi these days. ;)
[02:33] <qin> Taek: You can just download them to #/.irssi

[02:49] <Taek> Extras -> Options -> Advance -> Advance Networking Settings (TeamViewer server) Configure
[02:49] <Taek> should do the trick for you
[02:50] <nimdAHK_> so I can't add it to my account?
[02:50] <nimdAHK_> like I did with all my other machines?
[02:50] <Taek> I assume after you cofigure it, you should beable to do so
[02:51] <Taek> also note, since TeamViewer for (LOinux) runs in Wine - It might not actually have the ability to do it.
[02:52] <Taek> Linux*
[02:52] <nimdAHK_> Yeah I noticed the bundled wine
[02:53] <nimdAHK_> it's just interesting that the option is completely removed without a mention on the internet
[02:54] <Taek> that's what happens when a big company like teamviewer decide to go the lazy route and not actually make a linux specific software
[02:54] <Taek> instead just use windows emulation
[02:55] <soni1877> varunendra: http://pastebin.com/KbWFw2GP
[02:55] <Taek> Honestly I am happy TeamViewer even works on linux through wine, the horrors you have to go through to get alot apps to run on it period is bad enough.
[02:56] <Psil0cybin> Hey guys can someone help me I recently updated my computure through the update manager, and now when i try and boot into ubuntu i sometimes get a blackscreen or i get booted into the text only console, and cannot access the GUI. This only started happening after the update....and i have to restarted 3 or 5 times to get into the GUI
[02:56] <Psil0cybin> how can i diagnose and fix this error
[02:56] <Psil0cybin> or do i keep using the older kernal?
[02:56] <Taek> Just my guess, but have you updated the video driver?
[02:57] <Psil0cybin> I might have i updated everything it wanted to update
[02:57] <Psil0cybin> Cederview i think is the driver that got updated
[02:57] <Psil0cybin> but i tried reinstalling it, it worked for a few boots and now its doing it again
[02:57] <Taek> Never heard of cederview.
[02:57] <Psil0cybin> its for an acer aspire one
[02:58] <Psil0cybin> one second let me go to the package manager
[02:58] <Psil0cybin> and tell u exatly
[02:58] <Taek> Intel Atom Processor?
[02:58] <Psil0cybin> yes
[02:58] <Taek> D250 ?
[02:58] <Psil0cybin> D270-1628
=== Psil0cybin is now known as Psil0Cybin
[02:58] <Psil0Cybin> cedarview-drm
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> i think was the package
[02:59] <Taek> If I remember correctly, in my Acer Aspire One (D250) it used an Intel based chipset for the video
[02:59] <varunendra> soni1877, sorry, I missed that it was a usb device. We instead need to see "lsusb" (pastebin link again). Even better maybe if you post a detailed report following this post : http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12350385
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> To be honest i am not really sure :P I just know usually i allow every update, and nothing goes wrong, I am kinda new to Ubuntu thats why i want to learn how to diagnose it
[02:59] <Psil0Cybin> but you think its the driver?
[03:00] <Taek> It's a possiblity
[03:00] <Taek> when you get access to the gui again, try checking with the Additionhal Drivers
[03:00] <wilee-nilee> Psil0Cybin, Is it nvidia and did you load it from them?
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> its Intel i belive wilee-nilee and im in the GUI now
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> thats how i got in to talk to you guys
[03:00] <Psil0Cybin> Yea
[03:00] <Taek> I am pretty sure it's an intel based video chipset
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> I went to propietary drivers
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> i have both selected
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> drm driver for Intel GMA500
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> and Intel Cedarview graphics driver
[03:01] <Taek> Only one should be activated
[03:01] <Taek> Try the GMA500 Driver
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> so take off Intel Cedarview Graphical Driver
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> ?
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> like remove it
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> ?
[03:01] <Taek> select the GMA500 Driver and click activate
[03:01] <Taek> it will deactivate the other
[03:01] <Psil0Cybin> they are both activated
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> i only see
[03:02] <Psil0Cybin> remove for both
[03:02] <Taek> then deselect the ceder one
[03:02] <Taek> err Select the ceder driver and click deactivate
[03:02] <Taek> and then restart the laptop, it should work fine after

[03:16] <WACOMalt> Anyone in here familliar with qemu? I am getting terrible speeds on my windows guest and I assume it's due to the network settings in qemu. I havent changed anything fromt he default and although I get about 40Mbps upload on linux I get about 70Kbps on the windows guest
[03:17] <Taek> Why use qemu?
[03:17] <WACOMalt> because the server is headless
[03:17] <Taek> Not that it really matters in your choice, jut curious.
[03:17] <WACOMalt> and I was told it was the fastest
[03:17] <deezed> hey guys! I cant connect to a wpa wireless connection if there is any special caracther here, like é or ó. Do you know what can I do?
[03:17] <Taek> All my experiences with qemu have been horrible
[03:17] <WACOMalt> the server is headless and qemu gives you a vnc server directly to control the VM with
[03:17] <WACOMalt> it runs great aside from the network speed issue
[03:18] <Taek> is it running on a dedicated server?
[03:19] <Taek> FYI all my experiences with qemu have been on windows afaik.
[03:21] <deezed>  hey everyone, I'm trying to connect here to a wireless wpa2 connection which the password has special characters like "é" but I'm not allowed to connect,. Do you know what can I do?
[03:21] <Taek> Change the wifi password?
[03:22] <deezed> I cant, its from my girlfriend's house, and her mate wont like it
[03:22] <nimdAHK> sounds like you and the router are using different encodings
[03:23] <Taek> ^
[03:23] <deezed> nimdAHK: maybe...do you know how can I figure it out?
[03:23] <Taek> First off, figure out what enconding you're using?
[03:23] <Taek> I believe most routers use UTF-8 .
[03:23] <nimdAHK> try a different network manager too
[03:24] <Taek> Then again I am in U.S. so everything here is simplified.
[03:24] <deezed> nimdAHK: like which one?
[03:24] <nimdAHK> gotta catch 'em all?

[03:26] <Taek> No wLan? add it?.
[03:26] <ristra> usr13 it only list eth0 and lo
[03:27] <Taek> Is it a PCI(e) or USB Adapter ristra
[03:27] <usr13> What wifi device do you have?  ( lspci )
[03:27] <ristra> Taek, yeap that is the idea but since I am very new (i cant stress the @very@ enough!) I was wondering if it add it on a specific position or something

[03:55] <wilee-nilee> Moonlightning, Ubuntu tweak is in a PPA.
[03:55] <Taek> Old kernels should be removable with apt-get auto-remove

[03:56] <Taek> You can try with Ubuntu Tweak as wilee-nilee suggested.
[03:56] <Moonlightning> I only have a CLI though
[03:56] <wilee-nilee> Moonlightning, If you want a nice gui use the tweak, can be done from the terminal or synaptic as well.
[03:57] <wilee-nilee> the tweak gets the configs as well, nice little app really
