[07:53] <nathan> I have apache going and it works in that I can sometimes reach my website but usually it takes forever and then says timed out... that's if I use my other computer. if I use the same computer as apache and do localhost, it works
[07:53] <hhp21> Guys, something's wrong with my update in 7.04.. the updates are rolling in and building up and I haven't been able to get any for about a week and a half now. I have the errors on pastebin if anyone wants to have a look.. I really would like to get my updates, so any help is appreciated! http://pastebin.org/1929
