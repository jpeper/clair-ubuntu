[00:36] <shufflebot> Ben64: yeah because I'm switching users
[00:36] <apos> lubuntu has more artwork
[00:36] <genoobie> apos more artwork than xubuntu?
[00:36] <apos> yes
[00:37] <genoobie> hmm...I have lubuntu installed on another laptop and it seems reasonable
[00:37] <genoobie> but that laptop is a dual core 1gb
[00:37] <genoobie> anyhow, apos, lubuntu, xubuntu anything more streamlined DE?
[00:37] <histo> Ben64: su = switch user
[00:37] <Ben64> histo: i know...
[00:38] <genoobie> okay, so suppose I go with lubuntu, I have a *nix that has some drivers
[00:38] <apos> no dm and just run in terminal?
[00:38] <apos> lubuntu is fine. just adjust the swapiness
[00:38] <genoobie> should I get a printout of vendors (lspci) before I install lubuntu so the drivers work ok?
[00:39] <apos> if xubuntu works, im sure lubuntu will work
[00:39] <genoobie> yeah, xubuntu didn't quite work b/c of b43 legacy driver for wireless
[00:40] <apos> remove any and all unessesary startup apps and adjust the swapiness.
[00:40] <genoobie> so apos last thing
[00:40] <genoobie> 12.10?
[00:40] <usr13> genoobie: What does a DE have to do with a WiFi driver?
[00:40] <genoobie> usr13, shouldn't have anything to do with it, but one *ntu install worked, the other didn't
[00:40] <genoobie> all same params
[00:41] <genoobie> md5s ok
[00:41] <apos> 12.10 is working fine for me. just make sure your keeping up with the updates as always
[00:41] <genoobie> okay, good enough
[00:41] <genoobie> I could use the graphical installer but it wants lots of mem
[00:41] <genoobie> planning to bump up ram to 512
[00:41] <usr13> genoobie: Help with Broadcom bcm43xx can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx

[00:47] <unsobill> where to drill if I to change my default telnet client
[00:47] <unsobill> ubuntu 12.4
[00:47] <apos> drill?
[00:47] <unsobill> basically i got web-interface that should start telnet windows
[00:48] <unsobill> but it just doesnt open telnet promt ...
[00:48] <unsobill> plz hurry guys :(
[00:48] <apos> use gksudo instead?
[00:49] <unsobill_> gksudo for what ?
[00:49] <histo> unsobill: I don't think you want to change your default telnet app. To do so you would update-alternatives --config telnet
[00:50] <histo> unsobill_: ^^ Although this doesn't sound like your issue
[00:50] <unsobill_> its basically a web form thats calling this command : telnet://xxx.xxx.xxx.xx:2000

[00:53] <ubottu> histo: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[00:53] <Ben64> unsobill: just open a terminal and type "telnet 1.2.3.4"
[00:53] <histo> !dtailes | unsobill_  This would help.
[00:53] <unsobill_> ben telnet works
[00:53] <unsobill_> trying firefox
[00:53] <Ben64> unsobill: then use telnet
[00:53] <histo> !details | unsobill_  This would help.
[00:53] <ubottu> unsobill_  This would help.: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."

[00:53] <histo> unsobill_: In windows or linux?
[00:53] <unsobill_> ubuntu
[00:54] <unsobill_> nothing - same result on firefox as chrome
[00:54] <unsobill_> terminal window not being activated
[00:54] <unsobill_> arfgh
[00:54] <unsobill_> i can open terminal and easily telnet but command from browser doesnt work
[00:54] <histo> unsobill_: What webform?
[00:54] <unsobill_> u want tv ?
[00:55] <unsobill_> its basically lab farm
[00:55] <unsobill_> that has lots of devices to telnet to
[00:55] <unsobill_> u pick one - click open console to it and voila - terminal opens up with telnet connection to it
[00:55] <unsobill_> thats how it is on windows :(
[00:55] <histo> unsobill_: yeah with internet explorer maybe
[00:55] <unsobill_> nah with firefox and chrome
[00:56] <unsobill_> i suspect i has to do with this command :
[00:56] <unsobill_> telnet://xxx.xxx.xxx:xxx
[00:56] <unsobill_> basically ubuntu has no idea what to do with association "telnet://"
[00:56] <unsobill_> tghats my uneducated guess
[00:56] <histo> unsobill_: It's not that ubuntu doesn't but the browsers don't
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> unsobill, correction: the browsers don't know the connection.
[00:57] <unsobill_> should browser ask OS about associations then...
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> unsobill, ubuntu doesn't dictate a browser's interpretation of URL prefixes (telnet://, IRC:// etc.(
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> at least not afaikl
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> file associations, maybe.  prefix associations, don't think so.
[00:58] <unsobill_> awesome then i need to manually use my gnome connection manager to manually telnet to 30 devices
[00:58] <histo> unsobill_: Have you thought about installing an extension in chrome or firefox?
[00:58] <unsobill_> hmm
[00:58] <unsobill_> perhaps may work
[00:58] <histo> unsobill_: here's one froma  quick google search http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Google-Chrome-Extensions/Telnet-77530.shtml  Althought I would just look int he play store.
[00:59] <histo> unsobill_: also you could add hostnames for each ip.. Then just telnet whateverhostname   in a terminal
[00:59] <unsobill_> i guess i just use terminal manager if nothing else would work fine
[01:00] <unsobill_> no time for drilling
[01:00] <histo> unsobill_: I would look for an extension.
[01:00] <unsobill_> im on ubuntu - no luxury of simplicity :D
[01:00] <histo> unsobill_: would take less than a few minutes.
[01:00] <unsobill_> i installed it

[01:13] <histo> kitten_mittens: also what version of ubuntu did you install
[01:13] <kitten_mittens> 12.10
[01:13] <histo> Guest80061: yes
[01:14] <Ben64> did 12.10 change the grub menu?

[01:15] <kitten_mittens> yeah but differnt options
[01:15] <ElixirVitae> Hi~
[01:15] <mangdood> What ways are there of changing GNOME 3 settings? I haven't installed it but I'd like to be able to change settings to my preference
[01:15] <histo> kitten_mittens: ahh they changed that in 12.10 select advanced options
[01:16] <kitten_mittens> and my grub is version 2.00-7ubuntu11
[01:16] <Guest80061> When I right click on it from the home folder and click mount I get an error message "unable to mount volume"
[01:16] <ElixirVitae> I was wondering whether setting up a new system from minimal CD and adding packages or deleting certain packages from a normal install have difference.
[01:16] <ElixirVitae> Does it?
[01:16] <histo> kitten_mittens: under advanced options you should be able to select an older kernel version
[01:16] <histo> ElixirVitae: yes gets rid of a lot of bloat
[01:17] <kitten_mittens> ok, theres versions 3.5.0-22 and 3.5.0-17 and both have a recovery option too
[01:17] <histo> ElixirVitae: you can completely customize what's installed
[01:17] <histo> kitten_mittens: slect 3.5.0-17  non-recovery
[01:17] <histo> kitten_mittens: see if the system boots without errors
[01:18] <kitten_mittens> it froze
[01:18] <ElixirVitae> Can't I get rid of the said bloat after install by hunting them down via synaptic?
[01:18] <kitten_mittens> it says loading linux 3.5.0-17-generic... then under it says loading initial ramdisk ... and its frozen
[01:19] <ElixirVitae> I meant normal install, btw.
[01:19] <histo> ElixirVitae: Yeah I guess just a longer way of doing it.
[01:20] <histo> ElixirVitae: like if you are going to just install ubuntu-desktop from a minimal install then there is no difference.
[01:20] <ElixirVitae> I wonder whether they will be more or less equivalent.
[01:20] <histo> ElixirVitae: if you are going to start with a cli system and work up then there would be. I'm sure you'd miss a bunch of stuff going backwards.
[01:20] <ElixirVitae> I sure won't install ubuntu-desktop :)
[01:21] <histo> ElixirVitae: Like what are you trying to accomplish in total?
[01:21] <ElixirVitae> Another question, do configs change between 32 and 64 bit systems?
[01:22] <histo> ElixirVitae: no
[01:22] <ElixirVitae> I want to get a leaner system, and learn more in the process, but wonder whether the hassle would be worth it.
[01:22] <ElixirVitae> If it doesn't give me much benefit, I'd rather install normal and delete some parts.

[01:23] <JokesOnYou77> Hi all, how do I start an ssh session and then background it?  (And then bring it back to foreground and/or end it when I want to get rid of it)
[01:23] <histo> ElixirVitae: You could always create a virtual machine and install a minimals system and work up.. Ex: install xorg  then whatever de you wanted.  You don't have to use a login manager for instance or you can pick a lighter one.
[01:23] <histo> kitten_mittens: what did it still lock up?
[01:23] <kitten_mittens> it says loading linux 3.5.0-17-generic... then under it says loading initial ramdisk ... and its frozen
[01:23] <histo> kitten_mittens: okay time to try recovery mode
[01:23] <ElixirVitae> Great, I should test it in VM, that way I can check whether my configs carry over seamlessly as well.

[01:24] <somsip> JokesOnYou77: use something like screen or tmux, if I understand what you need correctly
[01:24] <kitten_mittens> but my nets going super slow, wont load the pages -_-

[01:25] <histo> kitten_mittens: could be many things. Bad hardware or software... We hve to test.
[01:25] <kitten_mittens> its not hardware, i have a nevery expensive motherboard that tells me whenever somethings wrong hardware wise
[01:26] <JokesOnYou77> histo, ctrl+z doesn't seem to work with an ssh session
[01:27] <histo> kitten_mittens: I wouldn't rule it out. Since you are experiencing these wierd issues.  But you need to try booting to recovery mode.  It should dump you at a terminal.  Then we can see if all the updates installed properly.
[01:27] <histo> JokesOnYou77: hold up let me try
[01:27] <kitten_mittens> ok
[01:28] <histo> JokesOnYou77: I would use screen then.

=== Granis` is now known as Granis
[01:29] <histo> JokesOnYou77: if you want to use jobs ie ctrl+z you have to ~ then Ctrl+z
[01:29] <JokesOnYou77> histo, I figured it out.  I can just use & and then fg the job number it gives when I want to get it back :)

[01:30] <histo> JokesOnYou77: although you still should checkout screen much more powerfull.
[01:30] <Ben64> yes, screen
[01:31] <JokesOnYou77> histo, thanks.  Yeah, my solution didn't quite seem to work, I could get the ssh session back just with fg but then something funky happened with the prompt
[01:32] <JokesOnYou77> And yes, I realize that screen is generally better but I'm using my GUI atm, and I don't like multiple gui terminal windows running AND screen
[01:32] <histo> JokesOnYou77: when you bring it back hit enter for the screen to redraw. But ~ then ctrl+z works here for me
[01:32] <kitten_mittens> histo im in the recovery menu, now what
[01:32] <histo> JokesOnYou77: What I use is screen on the remote machine.   So I can disconnect the ssh session. Then if I want to come back I just ssh back in and reattach the screen starting where I left off.

I'm actually starting an ssh session with a dynamically forwarded port to the remot host so I can use it as a SOCKS proxy from browsing on my local host.  I don't have anything to really DO on the remote machine, I just need the tunnel open

[01:41] <GoGetOperated> ./Go~Get\.
[01:41] <histo> kitten_mittens: Do you still have a cd lying around that you can boot to?  It would be a lot easier than walking you through configuring a network in command line if you just booted that and we repaired from there.
[01:41] <kitten_mittens> ok, i dont have cd i have usb for my pc
[01:42] <histo> kitten_mittens: or usb. I can't remember what you staid you installed from?
[01:42] <kitten_mittens> because it has no cdrom
[01:42] <histo> kitten_mittens: yeah boot to the usb drive you installed from.
[01:42] <Brewski> I'm looking for a QR barcode scanner solution for Ubuntu. We're looking to scan QR codes into a web form instead of manually typing them, so a "keyboard wedge" would be preferred (like credit card readers).
[01:42] <GoGetOperated> What ar you trying to do
[01:42] <Brewski> I know the software is there, is there hardware compatibility for any USB scanners yet?
[01:42] <kitten_mittens> done histo
[01:43] <GoGetOperated> There is a thing called Google look for ith there
[01:43] <histo> kitten_mittens: I have to go but basically you are going to try. Booting from usb.  Setup your network so it gets online. Mount the hard drive where ubuntu is installed.  chroot /dev/sdx replace sdx with whatever your hdd is.  Then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.

[01:43] <kitten_mittens> ok..
[01:43] <histo> Brewski: Barcode scanners are just detected as keyboards most should work with linux.

[01:44] <Brewski> thx
[01:44] <NewUbun> need some help

[01:45] <kitten_mittens> OMFG THIS IS STUPID
[01:45] <histo> kitten_mittens: I really recomend doing a memtest.  Or I suspect your original iso you downloaded was corrupt.

[01:46] <histo> kitten_mittens: hit the shift key and get the grub menu again and run a memtest

I don't know why this is, does somebody else experience this? My machine is decent (dell inspiron 14z N411z), and my ubuntu version 12.10
[01:51] <cainus> can anyone tell me the magic behind ln -s and why it never wants to work for me?  isn't it just `ln -s /real/path /pretend/path`  ?

[01:55] <Guest33132> im trying to burn an image iso of the newest ubuntu from a windows pc to use as a bootable new installation on my hp laptop that is having issues with windows. i installed a version of ubuntu i had from 2011 on the laptop and it worked except it is out of date and cannot be upgraded. so like i said i downloaded and am trying to burn the iso using nero 9 on a windows pc to then use to boot and install the 12 ubuntu on my laptop any
[01:56] <cainus> jrib: it only makes sense relative to my cwd... should I just give absolute paths?
[01:56] <jrib> cainus: you can use absolute paths if you want, yes
[01:57] <kitten_mittens> i feel as if im asking a pretty simple question
[01:57] <cainus> jrib: ahhh okay... so what does it do with the path?  writes it into the symbolic link?
[01:57] <cainus> jrib: so my relative paths wouldn't wortk
[01:57] <Guest33132> any help?
[01:58] <jrib> cainus: you can use relative paths, but they have to be relative to /etc/logrotate.d/couchdb, not your cwd
