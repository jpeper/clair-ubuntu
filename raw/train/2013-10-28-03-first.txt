[02:15] <Crazyzurfer> hey guys.. how do I know if my nvidia 650m driver is installed? --> using ubuntu 13.10
[02:16] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: can you see something on the screen?
[02:16] <Crazyzurfer> yes
[02:17] <uncle_ben> i have an issue with an older dell dimension 2400, during boot, bios always complains: alert: previous fan failure.  the fan works fine...i cleared the system event log and it made no difference.  one thing i noticed is the the fan cable has four female connectors, but the mobo fan connector has only three pins...could that have something to do with the error message
[02:17] <omnomnOMINOUS> Crazyzurfer, try going to Software & Updates > Additional Drivers?
[02:17] <Crazyzurfer> but I've got 2 video cards, and I know one of them is obviously working, but I want to know if the nvidia driver is installed
[02:17] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: it's installed ... you can see what drivers are getting loaded in your xorg log ... /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[02:17] <omnomnOMINOUS> I think that should tell you whether a proprietary video card driver is installed.
[02:17] <uncle_ben>  i got the computer used, so not sure if fan is original, but it works
[02:17] <omnomnOMINOUS> If I had chosen "encrypt my home folder" when I installed ubuntu 13.04, and now I want to do a clean install of 13.10 on top of it, without destroying my old data, is that possible? If I choose "encrypt my home folder" again, with the same password, will that be safe?
[02:18] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: you might want to have a look at this to get your optimus running: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
[02:19] <msdw> omnomnOMINOUS: you could try to update from the cd this way it  respects your data
[02:20] <hitsujiTMO> uncle_ben: sounds like someone replaced it with the wrong type of fan.
[02:20] <omnomnOMINOUS> msdw: I want to do a clean install, because my old install was broken. =/
[02:20] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: I've got it, because when upgraded to 13.10 I didn't have graphic interface, installed it and then worked... by the way that xorg log doesn't say anything about nvidia
[02:20] <msdw> then the safes way is to back up you home and then do fresh install
[02:21] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: have you run optirun on anything to test it?
[02:21] <Crazyzurfer> omnomnOMINOUS: It doesn't say anything.. it says, there are no aditional drivers
[02:21] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: nope, how can I do that?
[02:21] <uncle_ben> hitsujiTMO, i mean it's not critical...the fan works..i just hit F1 and keep going, but it's kind of annoying

[02:24] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: install mesa-utils that gives you glxgears. run it from the command line with and without optirun ... if theres a noticable difference in fps then you're good
[02:25] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: that looks like a known bug in firefox. try glxgears
[02:26] <uncle_ben> donavan01, try sudo lshw (assuming you have that package installed...if not...install it)
[02:27] <donavan01> I tried that and the only thing it says under wlan0 is wireless interface

[02:27] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: I see not difference, both worked at 59.8 and 59.9 fps
[02:28] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: its vsyncing ... i get 1k fps on a crappy gpu
[02:29] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: 2 secs, ill see how to turn off the vsync
[02:30] <hitsujiTMO> Crazyzurfer: do you have nvidia settings installed?

[02:39] <xrandr> from the repos
[02:39] <exco> only had unity
[02:39] <Crazyzurfer> hitsujiTMO: hahaha that's funny, the thing is that sometimes I get weird video behaviour. like when you have multiple windows open of the same program ex: nautilus and then you click twice on the icon on the launcher bar.. and you can see all the windows open.. there I see some withe lines around the windows and I just see the last opened windows, the other ones if you put the mouse in, you can see the orange border but nothing on those boxes

[02:45] <exco> jwm starts but reverts to login also quickly, Dr_Willis

[02:47] <exco> hmm .. may be ... but now I know it's nvidia related
[02:47] <zerodivided>  Hi I just installed cgminer on Ubuntu 13.10 using apt-get. I have an AMD video card. I now get this error when trying to launch an application. "Xlib: extension "NV-GLX" missing on display ":0"
[02:50] <zerodivided> So did the package break something. I've removed it and I still get the error
[02:50] <Dr_Willis> exco:  that is very very weird.
[02:50] <Dr_Willis> exco: id go old school. make a .xsession file that has 2 lines..    xterm &      and then     exec jwm
[02:51] <Dr_Willis> exco:  then stop the lightdm service and try 'startx' and see if you get a simple jwm + xterm desktop
[02:51] <Dr_Willis> if that also crashes back to the console. you should see some error messages

[03:24] <Dr_Willis> ubuntu-restricted-extras is JUST a meta-package jon1233  its job is to pull in the other packages in an easy way
[03:24] <FoShizz> Without damaging the acutal hdd?
[03:25] <jon1233> Are the original files available for download that can be transferred on usb?
[03:25] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  the dependencies for that package are also .debs yopu can download and install. thats how the apt system works
[03:25] <jon1233> have to transfer on usb after
[03:25] <Dr_Willis> foo pulls in bar and fii... you could install bar and fii seperately
[03:25] <mojtaba> I am using 13.10 and the clock is just disappeared from the top right of the desktop. Does anybody know what should I do? I searched clock in unity, but it is greyed out.
[03:27] <jon1233> Is there a website that has the restricted-extras .deb files for 13.10 for download alone?
[03:27] <Polymorph> Hello
[03:28] <Polymorph> I need some help please
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  the ubuntu-restricted-extas is a 'meta pacakge' it has no real content. it just 'depends' on the OTHER .deb packages
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  so install ing it  - forces the system to get the other packages. and saves typeing. ;)
[03:28] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  ubuntu-desktop works the same way
[03:28] <jon1233> Can I get those "other packages" from somewhere?

[03:32] <jon1233> Lost something? There's no page with this address in the Ubuntu One service. Check that you entered the address correctly and try again.
[03:32] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: Well, I'm running Chrome now. I'm using webchat.
[03:32] <Polymorph> I was in the login page and clicked "log in" - the address I have posted was cut from the address bar
[03:33] <FoShizz> What's a good way to mess with someone running a livecd?
[03:33] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: I looked in /usr/share/applications and found the desktop configuration file. The command was "/usr/bin/google-chrome-beta %U".

[03:34] <Dr_Willis> ShayGuy:  looks like its running the beta to me. :)
[03:35] <FoShizz> If I delete /etc, will I cripple a computer?
[03:35] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: Would the upgrade have somehow changed the command? Do I just try and change it back now?
[03:35] <Polymorph> Its OK - I have logged in from Chrome -wierd!!'

[03:40] <FoShizz> from the livecd that is
[03:40] <msdw> its a live cd that can be changed any changes you make when you reboot it will be the same
[03:40] <FoShizz> oh so you can store data on a livecd?
[03:41] <msdw> yes, but make sure that you dont have a mounted partition
[03:41] <FoShizz> wait idgi
[03:41] <msdw> on the cd no, on a usb yes
[03:41] <FoShizz> ok
[03:42] <FoShizz> yea cuz i thought files livecd's restart everytime while usbs can be permanent
[03:42] <msdw> yes
[03:42] <we6jbo> Hi

[03:45] <msdw> unles that you want a version that you can download and compile
[03:46] <SPEEDWAVE> hi
[03:46] <l_r> msdw, no i just need to know which version of g++ comes with ubuntu 13.10, as i don't have 13.10 installed to check
[03:46] <anudas> hi jmgk
[03:46] <Dr_Willis> FoShizz:  i run live cds on systems with no hard drives.
[03:48] <jmgk> anudas:  Hey
[03:48] <Dr_Willis> !find g++
[03:48] <ubottu> Found: account-plugin-aim, account-plugin-facebook, account-plugin-flickr, account-plugin-google, account-plugin-jabber, account-plugin-salut, account-plugin-twitter, account-plugin-windows-live, account-plugin-yahoo, activity-log-manager (and 15871 others) http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=g%2B%2B&searchon=names&suite=saucy&section=all

[03:49] <Dr_Willis> g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.8.1-10ubuntu8) 4.8.1
[03:49] <l_r> thx
[03:49] <jon1233> Is it possible for me to use apt-get vlc, then somehow collect those downloaded files and put them on USB to another ubuntu machine?
[03:49] <jmgk> anudas:  how is Ubuntu?
[03:49] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  thats what 'apt-on-cd' does
[03:49] <Dr_Willis> lets you make a moveable repository
[03:49] <Dr_Willis> !aptoncd
[03:49] <ubottu> APTonCD is a tool with a graphical interface which allows you to create one or more CDs or DVDs with all of the packages you've downloaded via apt-get or aptitude, creating a removable repository that you can use on other computers - See also !offline
[03:49] <jon1233> mmmmmmmmmm
[03:49] <jon1233> nice
[03:49] <Dr_Willis> cd/dvd or usb ;)
[03:50] <anudas> jmgk fine
[03:50] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: I gather I'm supposed to edit the launcher, but I don't know what the command is supposed to be.
[03:50] <jmgk> good good
[03:50] <jon1233> is there
[03:50] <jon1233> !aptonusb
[03:50] <jmgk> anudas:  on a laptop or desktop
[03:50] <jmgk> ?
[03:50] <xmetal> i usually just backup the DEB files themeselves, though APTtoCD is a good app
[03:50] <Dr_Willis> ShayGuy:  i dont know eitehr. i dont know what you are doing.  there MIGHT be a .desktop launcher for the non beta one. i imagine the command will be the same only without the beta :)
[03:50] <xmetal> themselves*
[03:51] <anudas> desktop
[03:51] <jon1233> how do I get the "show desktop" button on 13.10
[03:51] <jmgk> ah
[03:52] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  i recall theres some check box in one of the settings tools to enable it.
[03:52] <Dr_Willis> I never need it. ;) my desktop is blank
[03:52] <anudas> and you?
[03:53] <jon1233> hmm
[03:53] <jon1233> the ubuntu machine i have connected to internet is 10.04 LTS
[03:53] <jon1233> will apt-get VLC for the CD repository still work?
[03:53] <jon1233> to transfer to 13.10 cpu?
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:  thats going to make things a lot harder.
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> and no it wont work
[03:55] <jon1233> ;(
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> 10.X stuff is 3 years older then whats in 13.x
[03:55] <we6jbo> I have a computer with a mac address of b8:ca:3a:b2:a8:6c and the ip is 66.75.232.175. Is there a way to wake it up if I'm on a different connection and the computer is asleep or off?
[03:55] <jon1233> can i use the 13.10 cd to boot off of
[03:55] <msdw> jon1233: the best way would be to compile it
[03:55] <jon1233> msdw how do i do that?
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> boot the 13.10 cd on the pc with the networking.. intall vlc.. see wht it downlaods
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> copy styff to flash.. move it over
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> compile it? thats not the best way. he would have to download ALL the dev pcakges and stuff
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> then hope he can compile it
[03:56] <jmgk> hi Dr_Willis
[03:57] <Dr_Willis> jon1233:   a live usb with a persistant save file. with 13.10 - you could then install vlc on it.. and get the debs it used
[03:57] <Dr_Willis> is another way. (or use it to make an apt-on-usb setup)
[03:57] <jon1233> !apt-on-usb
[03:58] <jon1233> why cant ubuntu just have one file that installs it
[03:58] <jon1233> like windows has .exe
[03:58] <jon1233> can put exe on usb
[03:58] <anudas> jmgk
[03:58] <ShayGuy> Dr_Willis: OK, I'm going to try removing the -beta from the launcher. Wish me luck.
