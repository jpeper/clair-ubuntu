[19:19] <foormea> hey. i'm getting kinda confused over ubuntu's handling of init scripts. a while ago there was a mix between sysv-rc style and upstart style. but with 11.10 it looks like all scripts in /etc/init.d are sysv-rc style?
[19:19] <kubanc> anyone knows what should be the problem. I randomly got error composite sync not supported when i would like to have split screen (LCD and TV) on my Dell notebook. I'm using ATI mobility radeon X1400

[19:43] <ubukou> anybody knows the proper way to remove the ati driver and re-enable the open source driver? i used   sudo apt-get remove --purge xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx* and it resulted in failure.. had to reanable  it so i could boot gui..
[19:45] <zykotick9> ubukou: (just a guess), but after you remove the ATI driver, you probably have to move xorg.conf to a different name.
[19:45] <ubukou> zykotick9, hmm you think xorg.conf was trying to load fglrx?
[19:46] <zykotick9> ubukou: yes i do
[19:46] <ubukou> zykotick9, any reconfigure commands?
[19:47] <zykotick9> ubukou: just move it to a different name, xorg shouldn't be required for "open" drivers (ATI's open driver still relies on proprietary firmware - so i don't consider it open)
[19:47] <GiB_> Understandable, I was just reading the rules and it said something about topics. Anyways, recently got my computer today, installed compiz via the terminal. Since then when I log in using the 3D version the I no longer have a side dock or functionallity of top bar. At this point, seeing as how I have no data on this system yet, I would like to revert it back to its fresh out the box state.

[19:49] <ActionParsnip> damo22: uninstall unused kernels to free up space
[19:49] <ActionParsnip> damo22: run it with sudo.
[19:49] <ubukou> zykotick9, according to some folks over at #ati it does..
[19:49] <damo22> i dont have access to an account with admin rights
[19:50] <ubukou> zykotick9, ohhh sorry misread what you wrote...
[19:50] <damo22> i just have console access to 8kb of space

[19:50] <ubukou> zykotick9, any expirience on that ?

[19:50] <ActionParsnip> damo22: you can add the command to the sudoers file, it will not need password for sudo (you may need to still be in the admin group)

[20:14] <blitz> right click it shovell ?
[20:15] <shovell> that gines properties
[20:15] <ubukou> can anyone confim this? Vesa = generic driver  Mesa = opensource fglrx = binary?
[20:15] <blitz> right click the icons in the actual quick launch area shovell
[20:15] <mellifera> Vesa = generic driver, if your video card has got it
[20:16] <blitz> should get the keep in launcher icon

[20:16] <ubukou> mellifera, vesa is the driver that runs when you initialy install ubuntu then ?

[20:18] <auronandace> ubukou: i think vesa only gets loaded as a fallback option if no other driver is used and if the card supports vesa

[20:45] <auronandace> ubukou: when you say gui are you refering to any specific desktop? or does it not even make it to lightdm?
[20:46] <alexdevillx> I have a problem i dont know english well so can anybody give me an answer why i get this error  (voice_nitech_us_slt_arctic_hts) Error: HTS_Model_load_pdf: Failed to load header of pdfs.
[20:47] <mellifera> alexdevillx: are you sure it's really a pdf file, and not just called ".pdf"?
[20:47] <ubukou> auronandace, nope... :S
[20:47] <r3d0ctob3r> Hi guys ! I have a problem with my "apt-get"... And a old proxy I got. I deleted it, clean my /etc/apt/apt.conf file... and the console keep saying I cannot connect to 127.0.0.1:8118. Nobody knows about it please ?
[20:48] <ubukou> auronandace, it should at least crash trying to load lightdm right ? instead screens go out of range.
[20:48] <auronandace> ubukou: so you can't even get to the login manager?
[20:48] <zykotick9> mellifera: the error appears to be in connection with Festival, not PDFs
[20:48] <ubukou> auronandace, right
[20:48] <theadmin> r3d0ctob3r: Check the gnome's proxy settings as well as the $PROXY variable
[20:48] <auronandace> ubukou: wow, thats bad
[20:48] <ubukou> auronandace, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/FglrxInteferesWithRadeonDriver#Problem:%20%20Need%20to%20fully%20remove%20-fglrx%20and%20reinstall%20-ati%20from%20scratch check this out and tell me what you think
[20:48] <auronandace> ubukou: seems like you're stuck with using fglrx
[20:49] <mellifera> r3d0ctob3r: 127.0.0.1 should be your loopback interface, and should work on any port if your networking is configured correctly
[20:49] <ubukou> auronandace, search for need to purge

[20:50] <theadmin> alexdevillx: Check http://glados.biringa.com , other than that I can't suggest anything which sounds even remotely similar
[20:50] <mellifera> r3d0ctob3r: net packets for 127.0.0.1 should never leave your machine

[20:51] <TGIBT> What to do after install with nomodeset, i dont what to do next
[20:52] <r3d0ctob3r> mellifera I know. But I seek for the why apt-get redirect my commands to localhost but I dont find it. Indeed, I do everything I know... I used to use privoxy before I had this problem
[20:52] <ubukou> auronandace, im running compiz right now .. you should see how bad it looks..
[20:52] <ubukou> auronandace, its ok ;)

[20:52] <iwoj> gnome3 looks awesome.
[20:52] <iwoj> any thoughts on testing a parallel port?
[20:52] <alexdevillx> Ok, so i'll give a link with instructions http://glados.biringa.com/ go to the how the voice is generated. So i go (voice_nitech_us_slt_arctic_hts) in Festival through command prompt and at (SayText "I'm your master") a Error: HTS_Model_load_pdf: Failed to load header of pdfs.
[20:53] <mellifera> iwoj: you have no printer?
[20:53] <iwoj> mellifera: no printer : (
[20:53] <iwoj> mellifera: I'm trying to test a home-made CNC machine.
[20:54] <iwoj> mellifera: the problem could be the machine or the parallel port set-up.
[20:54] <iwoj> mellifera: I need to test the port first.
[20:54] <mellifera> iwoj: not too easy to test the port when you have nothing to test it with
[20:54] <tigrang> Ok so Using synclient -m 100 Im looking at the pressure of my finger. Looks like what I want the min to be to start moving cursor is around 20-25. I set PressureMotionMinZ to 1 and restarted. Doing synclient -l I can see it is set. Now when I do synclient -m 100 again and monitor as I move, it only moves after 30+ pressure. What can I do?
[20:55] <xj88> Hello all, and thanks to everyone who hangs out here, helping. I'm having some issues with a new install of 11.10. It installs without problem, but upon logging in, all I get is the desktop image and a cursor. Nothing else loads. I CTRL+ALT+F2'd my way into a terminal and upgraded all packages, so I should be completely up to date. Going into "Ubuntu 2D" works but isn't what I need. Any thoughts?
[20:55] <alexdevillx> How to generate glados voice?
[20:56] <TGIBT> Nvm, found it
[20:56] <theadmin> xj88: You need your graphics driver
[20:56] <lorenzo> hi, i am following this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router to set my ubuntu machine as a router. One thing I do not understand: when I set the internal network interface (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Router#Configuring_the_Internal_Network_Interfaces) what addresses should I put in? Thanks
[20:56] <alexdevillx> theadmin, Hello There
[20:56] <theadmin> alexdevillx: Uh, hi.
[20:56] <xj88> theadmin: How to get it?
[20:57] <alexdevillx> theadmin< Ok, so i'll give a link with instructions http://glados.biringa.com/ go to the how the voice is generated. So i go (voice_nitech_us_slt_arctic_hts) in Festival through command prompt and at (SayText "I'm your master") a Error: HTS_Model_load_pdf: Failed to load header of pdfs
[20:57] <theadmin> xj88: Log in to unity2d and from there search for an app called "Hardware Drivers". Run that, it should find the appropriate ones.
[20:57] <mellifera> lorenzo: your "inside" address, like (for example) 10.0.0.1
[20:57] <xj88> theadmin: I'll give that a shot. Regardless of whether or not it works, thanks for helping. =)
[20:58] <lorenzo> the one I get from iwconfig ath0 (ath0 is my internal network interface)
[20:59] <theadmin> alexdevillx: I'm not familiar with speech synthesis honestly -- I just gave you a possible solution. I have no idea how to work it
[20:59] <lorenzo> mellifera, I have an address for my cabled connection going to the outside (eth0), but I cannot see any address for ath0 which is my internal network interface
[20:59] <r3d0ctob3r> I ask my question again : I installed Privoxy few weeks ago, then uninstalled it. It seems to change my network settings... When I run a "apt-get update", I'm said that He cant download from 127.0.0.1:8118 ; however I uninstalled this proxy server, I changed my setting from system preference (dirrect connection to internet), /etc/apt/apt.conf is empty . What is going wrong ?
[20:59] <mellifera> lorenzo: if your outside interface is eth0, your inside interface would be eth1
