[00:24] <heretic9> hello, anyone happen to know how would I get or change an pin code with bluetooth -> mobile at shell only linux inst?
[00:25] <sabgenton> I want to push windows printer drivers where is the default samba share location to put them
[00:25] <sabgenton>  /usr/share/cups/drv/ ?
[00:25] <Flannel> heretic9: /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf has a way to set a pin.  I'm not really sure what you were asking though.
[00:25] <heretic9> no, it's not functional
[00:26] <heretic9> I got hcid.conf in place and set..
[00:26] <Guest23591> Hi, How do I make ubuntu only use one kernel, so my booting to windows by default doesn't get messed up
[00:26] <heretic9> unless you know someway to rehash/load it

[00:28] <cjae> Hi, How do I make ubuntu only use one kernel, so my booting to windows by default doesn't get messed up. sorry for posting more than once but changed my nick
[00:28] <Trek> cjae: you can remove the old kernel headers and stuff, i don't know the exact files you'd need to remove though
[00:29] <cjae> Trek: yes I know but I am not the primary user of this system, I put ubuntu on other ppls system so they will never know how to do that
[00:30] <Trek> cjae: in order to remove kernels you need to remove packages, if others are using Ubuntu, and you are the admin, you'll have to go remove the packages
[00:30] <Trek> cjae: or provide instructions ot others
[00:31] <dadoun> salut
[00:31] <cjae> Trek: I just thought the might be option to only use one kernel and upgrading it instead of getting multiples
[00:32] <cjae> upgrading = applying security patches
[00:33] <ambersean> hey guys, my neigbhors are installing 9.04, because we know it works, 9.10 didnt.  anyways, in the livecd i want to move their files over onto my usb hard drive.  but the livecd doesnt find my hard drive.  actually it sort of finds it but won't mount it.  maybe its a security thing?
[00:33] <ambersean> if i go into gparted, i can find my usb hard drive, but its not mounted.
[00:34] <ambersean> i think its a security thing?
[00:34] <jp--> Seveas is all installed sucessfully, I am now gonna reboot
[00:34] <jp--> :S
[00:35] <arand> cjae: Nope kernels are separate versions, to allow for fallback.
[00:35] <suhail> what command do i type on terminal to get yum
[00:36] <cjae> arand: ok so what if I have four kernel entries and keep it at that, will I get more than 4 kernels including the recovery kernels
=== jesse is now known as Guest52382
=== Guest52382 is now known as Brainsturbator
[00:37] <cjae> arand: or is that only if I upgrade the distro version 9.04 to 9.10
[00:37] <ambersean> its a permission thing.  how can i get around the permissions to mount this drive?
[00:37] <heretic9> so, anyone know how do you set an pin code at shell for mobile phone over bluetooth?
[00:37] <Brainsturbator> can someone help me with something? I cracked my monitor and its all rainbowy at the bottom, is there a way to change it to display my desktop ABOVE that part thats rainbowy? :P
[00:39] <arand> cjae: Every now and again a new kernel version is released, at that point you'll have to remove the old one to keep it at 4 entries, i don't know if there are any automated ways to do that, I know I've seen old kernel being uninstalled automatically, but I don't know the procedure in that...
[00:39] <plitter> is there a way to have an image in the virtual consoles?

[00:46] <Brainsturbator> i dont think
[00:46] <Brainsturbator> more of display settings?
[00:46] <robb> if the screen is cracked, then it's probably broken

[00:46] <ahmedaak88> im new to linux is there a way to learn all the aspects in linux a book you can recommend to me

[00:47] <jp--> Seveas, it won't boot. Says it didn't find the root device :/
[00:47] <BHoward> I had an update come through one time that did that to my screen on accident so it is possible
[00:47] <robb> i doubt there's a way to make a screen only use 1/2 or such
[00:47] <jp--> and it's the same device...
[00:48] <jp--> same kernel
[00:48] <Brainsturbator> well i dont want to change the area it displays... Kinda like Full screen and Widescreen works

[00:55] <kotsu> Right robb.. but after enable framebuffer I don't get anything.
[00:55] <kotsu> I googled and found people with the same problem.
[00:55] <kotsu> Wondering if anyone else is able to get it working under Karmic.
[00:55] <Trek> perhaps it was removed kotsu
[00:56] <Trek> or perhaps support for it was removed, kotsu
[00:56] <kotsu> Oh that would completely suck if they removed framebuffer.
[00:56] <kotsu> Certainly that can't be the case. :(

[01:32] <heretic9> there's million guides.. only got the issue on pairing the phone. just dropping me incorrect pin.

[01:33] <meowbuntu> i am wondering if there is a later version of openoffice. i have 3.1 atm
[01:33] <ZykoticK9> v3rr3z, reinstalling is your best bet, BUT you could theoretically try using dd or a livecd like clonezilla to move an installed system to another computer - you might run into issues with hardware trying this mind you, best of luck.
[01:33] <meowbuntu> Trek, yes i'm frequent here thanks though
[01:34] <v3rr3z> Thanks
[01:34] <nfv> hola atodos
[01:34] <v3rr3z> How do you uninstall Ubuntu.. Just del the partition?
[01:34] <mengu> hi. how can i remove a resolution that's in the output of xrandr?
[01:34] <nfv> tengo un problema con mi disco duro me pueden colaborar?
[01:34] <^kub^> !es nfv
[01:34] <ZykoticK9> v3rr3z, you don't uninstall it as you suggested, just install whatever you want overtop
[01:34] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, thats easy put cd in and install it
[01:34] <nfv> gracias
[01:35] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, how new are you to ubuntu and linux
[01:35] <qwertyjustin> hey guys, xstart in the command line at startup doesnt work?
[01:35] <Alestan> v3rr3z a fresh install can be imaged onto something else with more luck than an already configured system.
[01:36] <qwertyjustin> any ideas
[01:36] <v3rr3z> I need to move HDDs is the issuse.. The one I have Ubuntu on .. Is getting alot of Bad Sector errors.
[01:36] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, y do you want to uninstall ubuntu
[01:36] <nfv> lo que sucede es que estoy tratando de instalar otra distro en mi pc, iba a mirar las particiones que tiene, y cuando lo miro me dice que no tiene particiones
[01:36] <v3rr3z> Also.. Seems to be running slow.
[01:36] <ZykoticK9> qwertyjustin, the command is "startx"
[01:36] <blakkheim> !es
[01:36] <ubottu> En la mayoría de canales de Ubuntu se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español o charlar entra en el canal #ubuntu-es. Escribe "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y dale a enter.
[01:36] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, how new are you to ubuntu and linux
[01:36] <nfv> tambien trate de arreglarlo por un live cd el hirens boot, pero lo pongo en la unidad, reuinicio y no lo toma, lo salta y entra de una vez a buntu

[01:37] <meowbuntu> ^ v3
[01:37] <meowbuntu> v3rr3z, ok can i pm you
[01:37] <`mOOse`> verb3k, that's what clonezilla can do
[01:37] <v3rr3z> Indeed
[01:37] <`mOOse`> actually ghost is better at it actually
[01:38] <qwertyjustin> cheers
[01:38] <mengu> hi. how can i remove a resolution that's in the output of xrandr?
[01:38] <mengu> i'd like to remove these:
[01:38] <mengu>    1280x1024_74.90   59.9
[01:38] <mengu>    1280x1024_59.90   59.9
[01:39] <happyface> This PCs ubuntu installation is slow. Is there an easy way to reset everything just like a format, or is it better to actually reformat?
[01:39] <JStoone> cant, AHA! are you still there?
[01:40] <jp--> thanks for the help anyway. I'm installing Ubuntu 9.04 now.
[01:41] <`mOOse`> happyface, there is a pgm that will return ubuntu back to a "fresh install" state
[01:41] <TheLastDodo> A quick question... does Karmic Koala still use the xorg.conf to tweak things such as supported resolutions and the like, or has that functionality been moved?
[01:42] <robb> has anyone gotten a second card working with vesa driver as asecondary display?
[01:42] <seanbrystone> moose you got a link for that pgm?
[01:42] <`mOOse`> I think it's called computer janitor - look in synaptic
[01:42] <seanbrystone> k
[01:42] <jrib> !fixres > TheLastDodo
[01:42] <ubottu> TheLastDodo, please see my private message
[01:43] <Amaranth> robb: you can't do that, only one card gets its vesa tables mapped
[01:43] <JStoone> TheLastDodo, Yes it is still here. Go to "/etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[01:43] <robb> Amaranth: first card is agp geforce2ti using nv driver
[01:43] <Amaranth> robb: but the primary card is also the one that gets mapped
[01:43] <robb> oho
[01:44] <robb> so no way to get vesa + some other card, working
[01:45] <robb> Amaranth: ?
[01:45] <Amaranth> robb: no, they both need to have a proper driver
[01:45] <robb> that would confirm what my google-fu is sensing
[01:45] <robb> ok
[01:45] <Lx3> I want to have two window managers how do I do that?
[01:46] <racecar56> i'm using KDE 4.3.2 with a fresh install of kubuntu 9.10, and pidgin refuses to go inside of the indicator applet
[01:46] <Amaranth> Lx3: that is not possible unless you have two separate screens setup in Xorg (setup in the way that makes it so you can't drag windows between them)
[01:46] <robb> Amaranth: no where on web could confirm this for me
[01:46] <robb> thanks for helping answer :)
[01:47] <Lx3> Amaranth i dont want them at the same time different window for different manager
[01:47] <methods2> what happened to all the pulse audio configuration tools ?
[01:47] <methods2> the gui appears to be custom now
[01:47] <Amaranth> Lx3: err, you can't have a different one for each window
[01:47] <Amaranth> Lx3: you can quit one and start another but they cannot be running at the same time
[01:48] <Lx3> thats what i want
[01:48] <JStoone> Hi, how do I get my Apache server "online" and not only local?
[01:48] <Lx3> my windows of choice are Gnome (default) moblin (secondary)
[01:48] <mengu> JStoone: you mean i can't remove the resolutions? but i have added them?
[01:48] <snoopy> my ubuntu got a virus
[01:48] <racecar56> snoopy: how'd you get a virus??
[01:49] <snoopy> it keeps telling me to update
[01:49] <Lx3> snoopy: how??
[01:49] <snoopy> and i dont want too
[01:49] <`mOOse`> lol
[01:49] <`mOOse`> dang viruses!
[01:49] <snoopy> }:
[01:49] <racecar56> snoopy: it's a setting that makes it do that
[01:49] <racecar56> snoopy: i wish the ubuntu developers wouldn't have made it like that, it reminds me of Windows
[01:49] <JStoone> mengu, Sorry? what is your problem?
[01:49] <Lx3> Amaranth: any ideas??
[01:50] <mengu> i want to remove a resolution that's in the output of xrandr.
[01:50] <mengu> i have added them but i added wrong
[01:50] <Amaranth> Lx3: for that you should have a session option at the login screen
[01:50] <mengu> one is working good, others don't.
[01:50] <Amaranth> Lx3: you can't change desktop environments without logging out though
[01:50] <JStoone> mengu, ohm.. let me take a loo
[01:51] <mengu> JStoone: i added them with gtf
[01:51] <JStoone> mengu, aha...
[01:52] <Lx3> i am totally ok with logging out, that is what i want, but how do I install the moblin eviorment so I can choose?
[01:52] <racecar56> Lx3: make a file in /usr/share/xsessions called moblin.desktop
=== WaterRatj is now known as WaterRatj[A]
[01:53] <racecar56> Lx3: then put the contents of some other file in /usr/share/xsessions into it
[01:53] <racecar56> Lx3: and modify them to work with it
[01:53] <snoopy> i tired install linux on a mexican computer
[01:53] <JStoone> mengu, sorry I cannot help..
[01:53] <snoopy> and it didnt work
[01:54] <snoopy> it installs and all but insted of going to the desktop it goes to a blackscreen
[01:54] <JStoone> mengu, are you running dual screen?
[01:54] <mengu> i don't know what is dual screen
=== JimmyJ|zz is now known as JimmyJ
[01:55] <JStoone> mengu, two monitors?
[01:55] <mengu> JStoone: nope.
[01:55] <mengu> one old 17" crt
[01:56] <JStoone> mengu, so does this fault cause any harm to your screen? Is it misplaced or ?
[01:57] <mengu> JStoone
[01:57] <JStoone> mengu, yes?
[01:57] <mengu> nope.
[01:57] <mengu>    1440x900_59.90   59.9*
[01:57] <mengu>    1280x1024_74.90   59.9
[01:57] <mengu>    1280x1024_59.90   59.9
[01:57] <FloodBot4> mengu: Please don't flood, use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste, don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:57] <mengu> the only one that works is 1440
[01:57] <mengu> i have added the other two wrong.
[01:57] <mengu> i am currently using 1440 and i have no problem.
[01:57] <mengu> the problem is i cannot add another 1280 while these two are there
[01:58] <blakkheim> !enter | mengu
[01:58] <ubottu> mengu: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line - don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[01:59] <JStoone> mengu, oh, well.. I have no good trubleshoots, have you looked in your  xorg.conf and searched for something to delete?
