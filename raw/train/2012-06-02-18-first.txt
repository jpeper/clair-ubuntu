[17:09] <BlackZatara> My notebook is a HP G42-371br and he has two video cards
[17:11] <OerHeks> BlackZatara, optimus?
[17:11] <smerz> gmachine_24, "Power Management:off" when you run "iwconfig". can't recall how to disable it anymore :(

[17:12] <AptGetter> Hi. How do I do an "apt-get upgrade" but exclude certain packages? Specifically I want to "apt-get upgrade" without upgrading any Unity packages. Thanks.
[17:12] <BlackZatara> I'm having problems at the installation vga of my noteboo
[17:12] <odinsbane> Damn unetbooten froze again while setting up persistence. It doesn't like 3gigs either.

[17:13] <BlackZatara> um min
[17:13] <smerz> gmachine_24, which channel are you on, and which are your neighbours on?
[17:13] <smerz> because like channel 1,2,3 they all overlap. you really want to be 4-5 chans away from the mass. other than that I got no further ideas sorry :(

[17:38] <go8765> odinsbane: blogspot have pictures urls, like 3.bp.blogspot.* and wget dont download it, becouse it have not the same like blog url :(
[17:39] <escott> falematte, command &
[17:39] <falematte> escott, i tried that one too. In terminal it works but not in the script!

[17:41] <escott> falematte, (a) why are you specifying "env python" instead of just python? (b) for a python script I dont know how you would background a job. python isnt a shell
[17:42] <odinsbane> escott: that is the correct way.
[17:42] <Somelauw> Hi, I noticed that both wmii and awesome don't work correctly in ubuntu 11.10. Has support for everything besides unity been stopped?
[17:43] <Somelauw> Or has it something to do with my computer.
[17:43] <falematte> escott, i am folowing a guide, i dunno why the "env". I am using python because is really more flexible than bash! With the subprocess.call it should do the job! With google chrome it works!
[17:44] <odinsbane> falematte: you #! line is correct.
[17:45] <falematte> odinsbane, i think i need some Firefox option...
[17:45] <odinsbane> falematte: .call isn't as good as Popen. Is .call being called four times?
[17:45] <ssta> falematte: I don't think firefox spawns a new window from the command line if one is already open.  There's a -new-window option IIRC
[17:45] <falematte> Odd-rationale, yes

[18:30] <Frood> odinsbane: Because I have all the data on this one, and it's easier to just move the hard drive over.
