[19:39] <ActionParsnip> blueribbon: usb is painfully slow,despite what people may think or say
[19:39] <blueribbon> ActionParsnip: I lied. It does not work :(!
[19:39] <winb> ActionParsnip: Didn't work for me. I have no /appa/indicators/datetime in dconf-editor
[19:39] <ActionParsnip> stupid-by-defaul: just ask ad the channel will reply, if it can
[19:39] <arvislacis> ActionParsnip, Could you please get 8.0.4-0ubuntu0.2 version, rename it and send to me?

[19:40] <ActionParsnip> arvislacis: what is the output of:   uname -a
[19:40] <arvislacis> ActionParsnip, I have university Internet and it bans some keywords.
[19:40] <dcherniv> kieppie3, nomodeset might help if you have standard drivers

[19:46] <kieppie3> dcherniv: the ATI site seems to indicate the 4xxx-series cards are supported, but does not explicitly list individual cards
[19:46] <ActionParsnip> blueribbon: you can keep the PXE server updated, saves having to upgrade much once installed
[19:46] <ActionParsnip> kieppie3: there is a PPA with the legacy driver
[19:46] <ANTI-NON-FREE-OS> actionparsnip is there a way to upgrade to ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 with out loosing your files like videos and soforth from upgrading from a usb install

[19:47] <blueribbon> ActionParsnip: Seems like the dream to me ;)
[19:47] <ANTI-NON-FREE-OS> what backups

[19:48] <ANTI-NON-FREE-OS> not realy
[19:48] <ActionParsnip> ANTI-NON-FREE-OS: then why ask, just go for it
[19:48] <ANTI-NON-FREE-OS> i can actually do with out i was just hoping i dint have to back everything up
[19:48] <kieppie3> dcherniv: tried that - will do so again
[19:48] <ActionParsnip> ANTI-NON-FREE-OS: the upgrade  process doesn't delete any user data......
[19:49] <ActionParsnip> ANTI-NON-FREE-OS: you should have a backup if your data is of any value to you

[19:58] <cheesecakes> i think i may have found a bug in the users app

[19:59] <cheesecakes> i lose my password
[20:00] <cheesecakes> the user password and then have to reset it using root prompt
[20:00] <cheesecakes> because it fails to recognise the old password now

[20:07] <d4rkh4nd8> Is there a terminal command to restore Ubuntu to like new install. I dont wanna go thru the hole reinstall
[20:07] <ActionParsnip> AndreeeCZ: there are no sound cards detected in your system....
[20:08] <AndreeeCZ> ActionParsnip, I know. But why? The soundcard IS on the mobo. It has jacks and is enabled in bios..
[20:08] <ActionParsnip> d4rkh4nd8: if you make a new user and log in as that, is that how you want the system to be
[20:08] <d4rkh4nd8> Ya, basicaly keep the updates and loose any programs installed
[20:08] <ActionParsnip> AndreeeCZ: is it enabled in BIOS?
[20:09] <AndreeeCZ> yes, it has two modes: auto and disabled. Now its on auto.
[20:09] <ActionParsnip> d4rkh4nd8: the apps will not be uninstalled, all you need to do is default the apps
[20:09] <cheesecakes> ActionParsnip: still give it a shot
[20:09] <ActionParsnip> AndreeeCZ: i'd run:   dmesg | less     after a reboot and see if its deteted at boot
[20:09] <cheesecakes> make sure your root password is different thought
[20:10] <d4rkh4nd8> so new user and delet any olf files i dont want. Im giving the PC to a friend. But i cant do a new install my usb and cd/dvds are gone
[20:10] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: I don't have  root password, its not required or advised
[20:10] <cheesecakes> *though or you will have to go  into recoverymode
[20:10] <tinyhand> Ubuntu is awesome, i just switched from Mac OS X and im loving it!
[20:11] <ActionParsnip> d4rkh4nd8: if you boot to root recovery mode and dete the hidden folders (but not ~/.bashrc ~/.profile ~/.Xauthority and ~/.ICEauthority)  and reboot, you will get default folders made for your apps
[20:11] <cheesecakes> tinyhand: yehaa
[20:11] <d4rkh4nd8> okay thank you Action just wat i needed
[20:12] <ActionParsnip> d4rkh4nd8: make sure you have no configs etc you want to keep for apps in $HOME or $HOME/.config    but remove the rest
[20:12] <d4rkh4nd8> okay very kool thanks
[20:12] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: so just set my login pass in the GUI app, that's all

[20:13] <ActionParsnip> tinyhand: been saying that for years
[20:14] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: I dont ave that. After I click the password dots. I get current, new , confirm
[20:15] <cheesecakes> and then try to use the users password for something like sudo su
[20:15] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: using:   sudo -i    is advised
[20:15] <cheesecakes> dont you have a action drop down list ?
[20:15] <cheesecakes> above current password
[20:16] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: ahh got it, had to change a few things

[20:25] <cheesecakes> reboot and boot into recovery mode
[20:26] <cheesecakes> then do passwd
[20:26] <cheesecakes> and set a root password
[20:26] <cheesecakes> then do passwd <user>
[20:26] <d4rkh4nd8> so passwd root ?
[20:26] <d4rkh4nd8> okay thank you

[20:27] <d4rkh4nd8> okay awesoem thank you again
[20:28] <cheesecakes> anytime
[20:29] <Wiz_KeeD> or should i use the software center?
[20:31] <AndreeeCZ> ActionParsnip, im sorry. The GPU is there, its just not stated the vendor or model.

[20:32] <Jaclyn> Hi
[20:32] <cheesecakes> ActionParsnip: fixed what?
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: the password issue
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: or were you advising someone how to reset their password in root prompt?
[20:32] <cheesecakes> oh i was helping d4rkh4nd8
[20:33] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: please don't advise how to set the root password
[20:33] <cheesecakes> may i ask why?
[20:33] <cheesecakes> i think it is a good security measure
[20:33] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: its not supported, advised or necessary in ubuntu
[20:33] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: its worse, you have another account active, not better at all
[20:34] <cheesecakes> but isnt root active by default?
[20:34] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: the account is disabled for a reason
[20:34] <cheesecakes> or am i confusing distros
[20:34] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: by people I am very sure know more about Linux than you do
[20:36] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: if the user forgets their password, easy access to root console is really handy. If they also forget their root password then guess who has to dig them out?
[20:36] <Jaclyn> Is anyone willing to help me with two hardware problems and a wine problem?
[20:36] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: hardware
[20:36] <cheesecakes> the recovery mode would help
[20:36] <AceBlade258> let's start there
[20:37] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: they will need the root password to log in there, which has been forgotten....
[20:37] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: think
[20:37] <cheesecakes> ahh
[20:37] <cheesecakes> then the shadow file comes into play
[20:37] <cheesecakes> lol you are right sorry
[20:37] <Jaclyn> ok. Well, I upgraded from 11.10 to 12.10, and now ubuntu refuses to register anything plugged into one of my USB ports, and says that I have 1.7GiB of RAM when I have 2GB
[20:38] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: if you want to set it on your system that's fine. But don't advise average users who may be new to Linux how to do it
[20:38] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: it makes more work for supported
[20:38] <cosmicfires> what's a good usb tv stick to use with ubuntu?
[20:38] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: Only one usb port?
[20:38] <Jaclyn> Yup
[20:38] <Jaclyn> Just one
[20:38] <cheesecakes> ok cool will remeber this
[20:38] <Jaclyn> It has power, but if I plug a mouse or a keyboard or anything into it, it doesn't work.
[20:38] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: did you upgrade to Precise in between?
[20:38] <Jaclyn> Yes
[20:39] <cheesecakes> will not recommend setting the root password
[20:39] <ActionParsnip> cheesecakes: thanks :)
[20:39] <Jaclyn> I used the update manager to go from 11.10 > 12.04 >12.10

[20:39] <Jaclyn> Yes
[20:39] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: ram isn't a big deal, are you using/do you have integrated graphics?
[20:39] <cheesecakes> no problem
[20:39] <Jaclyn> BEcause I have a crappy 2006 laptop
[20:39] <ActionParsnip> Jaclyn: its using the system ram for the video RAM
[20:40] <Jaclyn> ok.
[20:40] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: you can change the ammount used in the bios
[20:40] <Jaclyn> Hmm
[20:40] <Jaclyn> Well
[20:40] <Jaclyn> That's fine
[20:40] <Jaclyn> I just wanted to know where it was
[20:40] <AceBlade258> Jaclyn: however, you should leave it where it's at, 256 is a decent graphics ram
[20:40]  * Jaclyn planned on leaving it there
[20:41] <AceBlade258> sorry, i tend to not read as i type
[20:42] <Jaclyn> issok. But what's going on with the USB port?

[20:52] <Reptile_Skillz> Hey, I was wondering if anyone could help me. My Network card is working, It can list the nearby networks... But it wont connect to them, even with the correct password! Could someone please help me?
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: what are you connecting to them to achieve?
[20:53] <Reptile_Skillz> A Conenction to surf the web
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: is it running a proxy software?
[20:54] <Jaclyn> BluesKaj: It shows five.
[20:54] <Reptile_Skillz> Nope.
[20:54] <luckyphuq> conall: use GRSYNC (a frontend for rsync)
[20:54] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: do other systems connect to it ok?
[20:54] <BluesKaj> Jaclyn, can you paste the output in pastebin
[20:54] <conall> thanks luckyphuq

[20:56] <Wiz_KeeD> everything worked ActionParsnip thank you
[20:56] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: check routing then
[20:57] <n0sq> some stuff won't play in firefox from usatoday.com - don't know what i'm missing
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: no wrries. The PPA makes life a lot easier
[20:57] <kgs> topper4125: here? :)
[20:57] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  I have. Ive also rebooted my Router And Modem.
[20:57] <Wiz_KeeD> i saw these instructions on some other site using google but i never got which way is the best to go
[20:57] <Wiz_KeeD> using software center, apt-get from repositories, adding other repositories and then isntalling, using debs to install
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: why are you using a system to get web access if you have a router?
[20:57] <Wiz_KeeD> there are so many ways
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_KeeD: there are lots of ways to do many things in any OS
[20:58] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah well installing in ubuntu has many of them :))
[20:58] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  No, I have a Wireless Router, And Im too far away to use a cable. I only have 1 cable in the house, And my Wireless card on my dekstop )Non Built In) Doesnt work
[20:59] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: did you setup the connection sharing in the other OS correctly?
[20:59] <Reptile_Skillz> ActionParsnip,  Yeah, I Did. My dad is even stumped on this one
[20:59] <BluesKaj> Jaclyn, that looks very normal , perhaps your mouse only works with USB2.0 , the others appear to be the older USB version 1.1
[20:59] <ActionParsnip> Reptile_Skillz: can you ping the sharing system ok?
