[10:24] <histo> neta: I have to get some sleep, but basically on that black screen you can edit the currently selected line and append nomodeset
[10:24] <histo> neta: others should be able to help. Just make sure you explain it's a UEFI based install and the black screen vs. the purple one.

[10:29] <jrib> burg: what kind of file is /projects/clients/client0/web1 ?
[10:29] <burg> jrib, is a directory actually
[10:30] <nathanbz> how do i make a folder in /var/run that doesn't get deleted on restart ?
[10:30] <jrib> burg: ls -ld /projects /projects/clients /projects/clients/client0 /projects/clients/client0/web1
[10:31] <burg> jrib, http://codepad.org/7zNe5BFr
[10:31] <histo> nathanbz: why?
[10:32] <burg> jrib, and ls -la /projects/clients/client0/web1 is http://codepad.org/em5LgBeg
[10:33] <nathanbz> i'm trying to put a pid file in there
[10:33] <nathanbz> ed2013-08-30 10:32:42 ERROR: pid 2738: could not open pid file as /var/run/pgpool.pid. reason: Permission denied
[10:33] <nathanbz> and that doesn't work
[10:34] <histo> nathanbz: why are you trying to put a pid file there?
[10:34] <jrib> burg: so does the ACL get set correctly on children of that directory?  How about parents?
[10:35] <nathanbz> where else do you put them ?
[10:36] <burg> jrib, i only get that error message. that is the location of a web server's projects managed by ispconfig, actually what i am trying to do is give full access to one user i will be using with samba
[10:36] <ItsMeLenny> what are other usb commands that can be run in terminal to get information on the device?
[10:36] <jrib> burg: if you drop the recursive flag and pass a child of that directory, does it work ok?  What about a parent?
[10:37] <burg> jrib, sudo setfacl -m u:ultra:rwx /projects works
[10:38] <burg> jrib, sudo setfacl -m u:ultra:rwx /projects/clients/client0/web1/web also works
[10:38] <burg> so the problems seems to be at /projects/clients/client0/web1
[10:39] <jrib> burg: are there siblings of web1?
[10:40] <nathanbz> it looks like i need a startup script to mkdir in /var/run

[10:40] <njuergens> burg, have you tried to check for the 'immutable' attribute via lsattr?
[10:40] <njuergens> ispconfig uses the flag in its default config
[10:40] <burg> jrib, only a symlink to web1
[10:41] <burg> njuergens, i haven't. how do i check it?
[10:41] <jrib> burg: lsattr /path/to/file
[10:42] <Yu-Yu> Hi, folks.
[10:44] <burg> njuergens, jrib, http://codepad.org/gPEjqXXW - doesn't seem to be immutable. but not sure
[10:44] <histo> burg: not it's not
[10:44] <jrib> burg: run it one directory up
[10:44] <jrib> burg: (or use -d)
[10:45] <burg> jrib, one up has i flag
[10:45] <jrib> burg: then that's the reason.  Good catch, njuergens.  Now you must figure out /why/
[10:46] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Hi again.
[10:46] <burg> jrib, i suppose i can remove the immutable flag, but the new projects will also have it, right?
[10:46] <njuergens> burg, that is something you can control via ispconfig settings
[10:47] <burg> njuergens, i am trying to find that setting, but with no success
[10:47] <njuergens> ok let me look, one sec :-)
[10:47] <mikubuntu> don't know what to do with this laptop -- it won't boot -- only goes to this screen msg, can anybody make any sense of it? sorry the image is not very clear :: http://imagebin.org/269196
[10:47] <sepero> Yu-Yu: hi
[10:47] <sepero>  :)
[10:48] <Yu-Yu> sepero: They changed the behaviour one switches layouts. And they didn't ask or take care. Could not catch that until booted GNOME shell.
[10:48] <No-one> mikubuntu: strange. Did it work before?
[10:49] <njuergens> burg, what language is your ispconfig admin menu?
[10:49] <burg> njuergens, english
[10:50] <mikubuntu> No-one: it worked until it didn't ... lol. i don't know, it belongs to my friends son. it supposedly had ubuntu on it and just stopped working (of course i don't know what he might have messed with). but now i can't get it to boot at all.
[10:51] <njuergens> burg, system->server config-><your server>->web->permissions
[10:51] <njuergens> there you find 'Make web folders immutable (extended attributes)'
[10:52] <burg> njuergens, thanks. let me check with a new website. until then, chattr -i /path/to/folder to remove the i flag?
[10:55] <burg> seems to be working. njuergens and jrib , thank you
[10:55] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:   the filesystem, or disk has gotten currupted.. given the # of times you have posted the questiin. You could have just typed the errors into a pastebin. :) and more people may have looked at it. ;P
[10:55] <Dr_Willis>  / is not getting mounted. so the other stuff /dev/ /sys/ and /proc/ also fail to mount
[10:56] <Dr_Willis> id start with a live cd, and fsck the drives/filesystems. then try boot-repair to see if grub can get fixed.
[10:56] <Dr_Willis> its possible the UUID has just changed.

[11:17] <mikubuntu> Dr_Willis: do you think it might take a boot and nuke, and then maybe accept booting from livecd? just occured to me?

[11:18] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  if the thing is not booting from cd. then i have to wonder if your cd/usb is correct. or the bios is booting the wrong device
[11:18] <aneesh_> Hi , I am getting some error when i tried to install eclipse. Just now I have installed tomcat 6 on my machine after that eclipse got closed and not opening http://paste.ubuntu.com/6043717/
[11:19] <mikubuntu> Dr_Willis: i definitely set the boot order to cd. that particular bios doesn't offer a way to completely disable the hdd, only move it down the list.
[11:19] <ikonia> mikubuntu: got a PPA enabled by anychance.....
[11:19] <ikonia> mikubuntu: looks like a package version conflict
[11:20] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  if you definatly have the cd first.. then that would suggest that the cd was burnt badly and being ignored.
[11:20] <ikonia> mikubuntu: sorry, that was meant for aneesh_
[11:20] <ikonia> not you
[11:20] <Dr_Willis> ikonia:  ;) i was wondering if i was confused ;P
[11:20] <ikonia> aneesh_: do you have any PPA's on your system, it certainly looks like something has created a conflict
[11:21] <ikonia> Dr_Willis: no, I was just wrong, read the wrong line for the wrong nick
[11:21] <aneesh_> yes
[11:21] <Dr_Willis> heh - i got weechat where it colorized the name/nicks and their text the same  now. :)
[11:21] <ikonia> aneesh_: ok, so that's a very very likely reason for the cause
[11:21] <mikubuntu> Dr_Willis: hmmmm ... so cfhowlett told me to do an md5sum the other day and it checked out -- but you're suggesting the actual burn might be bad?
[11:21] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  its very possible the actual BURN to the CD is bad. yes.
[11:21] <ikonia> Dr_Willis: sadly I'm on a green console like the matrix due to lack of terminal emmulation on the machine I'm using ssh on
[11:22] <Monday> what do i type to install xfce so that i can test it out, then what do i type to remove it after without removing the xfce stuff for lubuntu
[11:22] <Dr_Willis> I tend to boot from USB mikubuntu  much easer
[11:22] <mikubuntu> Dr_Willis: i tried usb also, wouldn't boot from that either
[11:22] <Dr_Willis> ikonia:  :) I finally got rid of my old Serial-terminals ;)   Oh the good old days
[11:22] <aneesh_> but before installing apache tomcat6 my eclipse installtion is working  fine ikonia
[11:23] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  try a simple distro like tiny-core linux make a bootable usb of that. see if it boots on other machines then test on yours.. Its likely your machine is being a pain and not wnating to boot from anything else.
[11:23] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Hi again.
[11:23] <mikubuntu> Dr_Willis: ok, thx
[11:23] <Dr_Willis> mikubuntu:  if you want to go hard core on it. :) remove the HD. plug it in a USB enclosuer and  try to fix it from a differnt pc. or boot that pc with a cd/usb and plug the enclosure in
[11:24] <sepero> Yu-Yu: hey  :)
[11:24] <Dr_Willis> $20 for a Universial HD -> usb adaptor - is Money that was well spent by me in the last year.
[11:24] <aneesh_> ikonia this is the list of ppa which i have in my machine http://paste.ubuntu.com/6043738/ please tell which one i have to remove
[11:24] <mikubuntu> Dr_Willis: ok, will try something :P
[11:24] <nathanbz> anyone know how to change permissions in an upstart script ?
[11:24] <Yu-Yu> sepero: They broke my awesome xsession that it didn't work until I found what's the problem. Also, they surprisingly changed layout switching to Super+Space. Why, ever?…
[11:25] <ikonia> aneesh_: I'd suggest using none unless you have confidence that the person who maintains it has a clue about what he's doing
[11:25] <Yu-Yu> sepero: And until I got in a full GNOME Shell, I couldn't ever get they did the change.
[11:26] <nathanbz>  exec /bin/chown pgpool:root /var/run/pgpool <- doesn't seem to work :(
[11:26] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Of course, you can say I still can use Windows 8 or Mac, yah.
[11:26] <sepero> Yu-Yu: Do you want to change the layout switching hotkey?
[11:26] <BluesKaj> 'Morning all
[11:26] <aneesh_> ok ikonia thanks for your suggestion . I will check it out.
[11:27] <Yu-Yu> sepero: I did want. And I told you.
[11:27] <sepero> Yu-Yu: Well, I think you did a good job then
[11:29] <Yu-Yu> sepero: I don't think someone should do this work after another update.
[11:29] <sepero> Yu-Yu: Me either. It's just not right
[11:31] <Yu-Yu> sepero: It's just why I prefer to test things before they get to regular users. And that's why I'm on 13.10. Now you see?
[11:32] <sepero> Yu-Yu: I see, but I say you will still like 12.04 better. In the end, you will want a system that just works easy
[11:33] <Monday> what do i type to install xfce so that i can test it out, then what do i type to remove it after without removing the xfce stuff for lubuntu
[11:33] <jrib> !xubuntu | Monday
[11:33] <ubottu> Monday: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce as the desktop environment. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org/ - To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop » - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
[11:33] <sepero> Yu-Yu: That's why you will make the right choice and go with 12.04
[11:34] <sepero> Yu-Yu: You will be happy
[11:34] <Monday> jrib, how would i remove it
[11:35] <sepero> Monday: the package to install is xubuntu-desktop
[11:35] <Dr_Willis> its harder to remove then install. ;)
[11:35] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Why not everyone use 12.04 so, tell me?
[11:35] <Dr_Willis> thats the curse of 'meta-packages'
[11:36] <jrib> Monday: apt-get remove the package
[11:36] <sepero> Yu-Yu: Because they are confused  ;)
[11:36] <Dr_Willis> removeing xubuntu-desktop wont automatically remove all teh stuff the meta package installed.. unless theres been some changes ive missed.
[11:36] <jrib> Monday: you can use autoremove afterwards to remove any packages you don't need
[11:37] <Dr_Willis> Monday:  cleanest way to 'test' would be just to try xubuntu  live cd in virtualbox.
[11:37] <Monday> sudo  apt-get autoremove xubuntu-desktop ?
[11:37] <Yu-Yu> sepero: Are you using 12.04?
[11:37] <sepero> Yu-Yu: yes, I am
[11:37] <jrib> Monday: no.  apt-get remove xubuntu-desktop && apt-get autoremove
[11:38] <jrib> Monday: maybe apt-get remove --auto-remove xubuntu-desktop, but I've never used this form
[11:39] <Dr_Willis> err.. I just did a 'apt-get remove kubuntu-desktop' then 'apt-get autoremove' and it dident remove anything with autoremove
[11:39] <jrib> Dr_Willis: depends on how kubuntu-desktop was installed
[11:39] <Dr_Willis> with apt-get install kubuntu-desktop   as far as i rember. ;)
