[07:13] <Judicata> Tonren: if you want to try the fglrx driver, which is much faster than the OSS drivers right now, you can install xorg-driver-fglrx and fglrx-control. Then disable the composite option (i'll pastebin the code for you), change "ati" to "fglrx" and everything will probably be fixed.
[07:13] <EnsignRedshirt> haakuturi: Is bitweaver something you are trying to compile?
[07:13] <Tonren> Judicata: Sure, pastebin away.
[07:13] <arrenlex> Tonren: Be very careful with the fglrx driver. It was coded by a blindfolded intern in Notepad as part of a hazing process.

[07:13] <PirateHead> When I plug my camera into my computer using a USB connector, it launches a GUI window to import my pictures, which is great. Unfortunately, the GUI window can only access the device if I configure it to gksudo before launching the GUI; and if I do that, then it imports the pictures as root and I have to chown them. How do I automatically make the device readable by my user before launching...
[07:13] <PirateHead> ...the GUI?

[07:36] <mustiy_> Tonren, haha wow - words elude me as to how i feel atm.
[07:36] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: It depends how the drive was originally formatted. If you are running windows now, there might be a way to check the filesystem type, but I don't know what it is.
[07:36] <mustiy_> Thanks a bunch
[07:36] <Tonren> mustiy_: It's OK.  This stuff is easy to be confused aobut at first
[07:37] <nano> arrenlex, so generic can handle all types of architectures..but not necessarily optimized right?
[07:37] <arrenlex> nano: And they said unto the people: hark! No longer will you have to install kernels for your subarchitectures to get features you want! Here is -generic, and it provides all the features you want without significant loss of speed!

[07:51] <lebowski> christian1222, well .. check the size of the file on vfat and your copy of it
[07:51] <svfusion> how much longer are you going to be here
[07:51] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: vfat's maximum file size is 4gig.
[07:51] <christian1222> yea
[07:51] <christian1222> thats how big the file is on the Hd
[07:51] <MacLinuxMaster> set: why you can't insytall ?
[07:51] <christian1222> but mine is 4.2

[07:52] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: Right.
[07:52] <christian1222> lebowski: mine: 4.2, vfat: 4
[07:52] <lebowski> christian1222, yeah, that's the problem, it won't copy

[07:53] <lebowski> christian1222, unless you split it up or something, but that wouldn't be very useful, unless your friend has a partition that can handle files larger than 4 gigs (ntfs)
[07:53] <christian1222> lebowski: so what would you recommend? could I copy the files seperately? they dont need to be all in an iso to install correct? just in the same directory
[07:53] <esc_ape> can someone do me a favor & send me a message to my gaim (aim account)?
[07:53] <lebowski> christian1222, does your friend have an NTFS volume? what windows is he running?
[07:53] <christian1222> lebowski: if he wanted, could he erase all data from the HD and then reformat in NTFS or FAT-32?
[07:53] <svfusion> lebowski what driver do you recommand?
[07:54] <christian1222> lebowski: hes running Mac OS
[07:54] <oFF-beAt> start up commands in "sessions" which requires root accees.. will not b executed right?
[07:54] <lebowski> vfat is FAT32 .. again .. write support for ntfs, I wouldn't trust completely

[07:55] <lebowski> svfusion, I used the ati binary driver off the ubuntu guides
[07:55] <christian1222> lebowski: will linux and mac both run that? what about windows? eventually the file has to be taken off the drive from a windows box

[07:55] <svfusion> that one?
[07:55] <lebowski> christian1222, windows wouldn't be able to read it, unless you install a tool called macdrive

[07:56] <christian1222> lebowski: so what would all 3 be able to read? ntfs?
[07:56] <lebowski> svfusion, yeah

[07:56] <svfusion> k
[07:56] <svfusion> manually or apt-get
[07:56] <lebowski> christian1222, yes .. ntfs .. but the question is, you cannot gurantee write-reliability if you use anything other that windows to write to it
[07:57] <lebowski> christian1222, but well, its not that terrible
[07:57] <christian1222> lebowski: oh really? what about md5sum?
[07:57] <christian1222> since its an iso
[07:57] <lebowski> christian1222, md5sum? what about it?
[07:57] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: They should all be able to *read* ntfs.  I don't know much about the mac writing ntfs, and my knowledge may be out-of-date, but writing ntfs from linux used to be unreliable.
[07:57] <xinted> its not terrible at all,  i agree

[07:57] <dxdemetriou> when a pc crash, can I find somewere the reason? logs or something?
[07:58] <lebowski> EnsignRedshirt, writing to ntfs from mac and linux is not safe yet
[07:58] <xinted> ntfs3g  works exceptionally well, considering that ms never allowed anyone access their ntfs
[07:58] <nothlit> I find ntfs-3g works fine
[07:58] <lebowski> dxdemetriou, dmesg
[07:58] <MacLinuxMaster> xinted: I really can confirm
[07:58] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: ok, thanks guys, i think i am just going to try and put the files from the iso on the drive
[07:58] <lebowski> ntfs3g, that's what I was looking for :D
[07:59] <christian1222> EnsignRedshirt: lebowski: rather than trying to change the FS, would that work to install on windows, if they were all in the same directory, not from the same image?
[07:59] <EnsignRedshirt> christian1222: That seems to be the only option.  Unless you can skip using the drive, and connect your computers via a network.
[07:59] <xinted> so the opensource community has done very well indeed to bring the write access to the whole
[07:59] <mainer> dxdemetriou: /var/log/syslog /var/log/kernel.log /var/logmessages.log ... etc...
