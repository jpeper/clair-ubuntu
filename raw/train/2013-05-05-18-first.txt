[18:17] <nownot> or maybe you can, don't know wtf i was looking at …

[18:18] <wilee-nilee> shankstaBytes, This is not ubuntu complaints but support.
[18:18] <Walex2> nownot: what can do is to schedule a script every minute, and then the scripts does 11 repetitions every 5 seconds.
[18:18] <Walex2> nownot: in that way you get the automatic running of CRON and the every-5-seconds that you want.
[18:18] <nownot> agh, so the /11 will do a minute /11 so every 5 seconds
[18:18] <nownot> gotcha coach, thanks!
[18:19] <Walex2> nownot: something like 'for N in {1..11}; do SOMETHING; sleep 5; done' and you run that as a CROn job

[18:27] <Gerowen> Question: I've been using Google Chrome for a while, and starting after the upgrade to 13.04, if I use peppermint flash, flash videos lag horribley in fullscreen.  If I disable peppermint flash and use the flash from the repositories, flash videos play just fine, but random web page elements get garbled beyond usage, some of which don't even appear to use flash, like the photo uploader on Facebook.  Reference this screenshot: ht

[18:52] <XHEART24> by changing from mp4 to avi will it increase in size?
[18:53] <Dr_willis> if you can find a video it CAN play. you can see what codec its using

[18:53] <nanvou> how do I do that ?
[18:53] <mizifih> XHEART24: it depends on what you're going to do with the file, but he's saying just to change the extension

[18:56] <XHEART24> ok
[18:56] <mizifih> AVI is not a video format
[18:56] <mizifih> it's just a container
[18:56] <Dr_willis> it might just need tobe called whatever.avi   instead of whatever.mp4
[18:56] <Dr_willis> or it might have to be some specific codecs
[18:57] <mizifih> Sony...
[18:57] <mizifih> It's probablu AVC something

[18:57] <mizifih> is it AVC... I had some trouble with my PSP back when I used it to play videos
[18:57] <Dr_willis> hard to tell with sony these days.. the PSP i recall played mp4's but they had to be special encoded
[18:57] <mizifih> avc
[18:57] <mizifih> I think it was avc, if the name is right
[18:57] <nick14> mizifih: right, just a container?
[18:58] <mizifih> AVI, yeah
[18:58] <mizifih> Dr_willis: say the word, LOL
