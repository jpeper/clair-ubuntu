[07:33] <toluene> hi ! I have setup a ppa server. One of the .deb have problem so I unpack it with "ar", correct the code and pack it back with "ar", after that I replace the .deb in ppa and update "content-length" in the corresponding head file. However, my client got "size-mismatch", after issuing apt-get. What mistake have I made in the process ?
[07:33] <urlin2u> ;-)
[07:33] <gskelling> livingdaylight, once you can access the subsonic web interface, you can do everything from there. its like setting up a router
[07:33] <gskelling> just click settings =P

[07:38] <dzup> how can i rebuild all my gnome settings? not just the ones in my $HOME but all the system wide gnome modifications i made and restore that to defaults without killing my system in the process (reinstall i386 maverick)?
[07:39] <livingdaylight> *web
[07:39] <urlin2u> HSarena, log into the classic you can choose it at login, in the menu is a application called additional drivers. You want to run a update and upgrade first though.
[07:39] <dzup> or should i reinstall?
[07:39] <gskelling> livingdaylight, typing http://localhost didn't work? or http://localhost:4040
[07:39] <bazhang> dzup, got any ppa?

[07:40] <flametai1> Hey guys, quick question, is there a difference between Wine and WineHQ? o.O WineHQ is just Wine's official site correct? Or is there actually another Wine called WineHQ? Was reading a forum and someone mentioned to try "WineHQ" but never clarified what they meant.
[07:40] <bazhang> dzup, more importantly , got a separate /home partition?
[07:40] <livingdaylight> gskellig, ok, lol
[07:40] <gskelling> it's a website hosted on your computer.
[07:40] <dzup> bazhang: no, i can put everything back but only if i can have gconf2 settings back to normal
[07:40] <HSarena> Ooooh, i understand
[07:40] <bazhang> flametai1, the channel #winehq
[07:40] <livingdaylight> gskellig, ok, and now I'm invited to register an account, ok.. Seriously, I'm a noob, lol
[07:41] <HSarena> urlin2u : there is 3 drivers
[07:41] <HSarena> urlin2u : which one i have to install????
[07:41] <urlin2u> HSarena, have you run a update and upgrade
[07:41] <HSarena>  urlin2u : yes
[07:41] <dzup> bazhang: then if i get everything back to defaults settings i promise you i will not ever do a recursive gconf2 deal :(
[07:42] <HSarena>  urlin2u : just 1 hours ago
[07:42] <urlin2u> HSarena, do any of them resemble your graphic card?
[07:42] <filsuf> what's the shortcut for moving between TABS in KONSOLE?
[07:42] <filsuf> alt-shift-arrow?
[07:43] <gskelling> livingdaylight, I'm not familiar with newer versions of subsonic, when I installed it I just went to http://localhost:4040 and started setting it up
[07:43] <HSarena>  urlin2u : there are 3 nvidia drivers

[07:43] <rethus1> how can i completly format a hdd on linux?
[07:43] <rethus1> remove all data in secure way
[07:43] <bazhang> rethus1, gparted live cd
[07:44] <rethus1> it's a usb-hdd
[07:44] <gskelling> fdisk!
[07:44] <livingdaylight> gskellig, do you have to create a username or just the password (its what it seems) and there seems to be a default /var/music path set. But I change that to /home/username/Music ?
[07:44] <urlin2u> HSarena, this is where I can't really help, so we are farther along though as far as important info others would probably need to help.
[07:44] <Axlin> filsuf: Should be ctrl-shift-pgup/pgdown
[07:44] <rethus1> fdisk only change partition-table... seems nbot to erase all given data on it
[07:44] <bazhang> rethus1, its  a 60mb iso
[07:44] <filsuf> Axlin: doesnt work
[07:44] <Axlin> filsuf: Er, without shift, rather.
[07:45] <filsuf> it used to work though
[07:45] <filsuf> same shit
[07:45] <bazhang> filsuf, no cursing
[07:45] <HSarena> urlin2u : ok, thanks u, i think i can fix it ;-)
[07:45] <filsuf> not for me
[07:45] <bakytn> Hello! Please help me....where can I set up the default profile? I copied .gconf and .gnome2 to /etc/skel but it's not working...it's still loading from somewhere else
[07:45] <urlin2u> HSarena, cool.
[07:45] <stowoda> hi, my lower panel is auto hided and wont show up again.. How can i fix this?
[07:45] <gskelling> livingdaylight, I can't remember, like I said I haven't used it in awhile. If you're at the web interface you're on the right track though. Remember the point of subsonic is to share your music with any computer in the world, so a username and password are a good idea to prevent any random stranger from getting to it
[07:46] <dzup> bazhang: if i apt-get --purge gnome ...and the reinstall it will erase all those "custom" systemwide modifications i made erlier?
[07:46] <gskelling> livingdaylight, if I remember their website is pretty helpful, they have a good FAQ section and some decent walkthroughs
[07:46] <Axlin> filsuf: When you say "Konsole", are you referring to GNOME/Unity, or KDE?
[07:46] <rww> Axlin: Konsole is the KDE terminal emulator
[07:46] <pyarun> hey, need help with dir permessions..i have a parent dir P to whichi have given some recursive permissions which are applied to sub-dir s1. Now i create a new sub-dir s2, is there any way that child dir takes the permission of parent dir
[07:46] <livingdaylight> gskellig, ok, thanks again for everything and pointing me in the right direction :D
[07:46] <drussell> rethus1: try a command called "shred"
[07:46] <bazhang> dzup, no, not sure what you modified however
[07:47] <Axlin> filsuf: Thought so. You should be able to go into Settings->Shortcuts, to see what it's assigned to.
[07:47] <rethus> how secure is erase th hdd on this way? Is there a way to restore the data?
[07:47] <dzup> bazhang: you know a way to get defaults values back into gnome?
=== gskelling is now known as Gskellig
[07:48] <drussell> rethus: it's very secure
[07:48] <rethus> or is it better to rewrite each sector of the hdd with dd if=/dev/zero /dev/sdb ?
[07:48] <drussell> rethus: no, that's not very secure
[07:48] <drussell> rethus: if you look up shred you'll see it overwrites the area multiple times
[07:49] <drussell> rethus: making recovery nearly impossible
[07:49] <stowoda> oh, :) this helped me, especially post #16: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1201800&page=2
[07:49] <rethus> shred is a cmd-commend?
[07:49] <drussell> rethus: yes
[07:50] <drussell> rethus: "man shred" for more info
[07:50] <rethus> k, but seems this only works wor single files, not for a complete partition
[07:52] <drussell> rethus: no, it works on partitions also
[07:54] <bond007> goodmorning
[07:54] <rethus> now i only need a hdd test-tool which return a nice report of hdd-health
[07:54] <Gskellig> rethus, you can join my mission to get phoronix test utility working
[07:54] <Gskellig> its a really good benchmarking and testing utility, but I can't get the gui to work =/
[07:56] <rethus> Gskelling: sorry, have no time for that... i'm very busy and only search for a working tool
[07:57] <bond007> is x2go availbale in the new ubunt 11.10 or is there one alternative??
[07:57] <Gskellig> =P I know haha
[07:57] <drussell> rethus: smartctl
[07:57] <Gskellig> it was worth a shot
[07:57] <Gskellig> it might work for you actually

[08:00] <jose__> Hi, which is the best backup software for ubuntu, i want save my actual ubuntu state, files is less important...
[08:02] <drussell> rethus: then there's pretty much nothing you can do, apart from run a check for badblocks on a regular basis
[08:05] <urlin2u> jose__, best is relative to any user, clonezilla will image the whole thing. You can also save a file of all installed apps and the source list, other methods as well, I use these.
[08:07] <jose__> ok urlin2u, u know if clonezilla can write in ext4?
[08:07] <jose__> i want my hdd image in other partition with ext4 format
[08:08] <urlin2u> jose__, oh yes it packages to ntfs ext, and others.
[08:09] <jose__> urlin2u, ok i will try that later, thx!

[08:14] <zabomber> hey guys
[08:14] <zabomber> i need some help with WebDAV
[08:14] <ryry> hey
[08:14] <zabomber> http://pastebin.com/M0xLPULj
[08:14] <zabomber> theres my apache config
[08:14] <zabomber> no matter what i try
[08:14] <urlin2u> atdprhs, remove the os-prober
[08:14] <zabomber> i keep getting site not enabled for webdav
[08:14] <zabomber> when i try cadaver into it
[08:14] <urlin2u> in that install the external
[08:14] <atdprhs> what do you mean urlin2u?
[08:15] <overclucker> rww: i'm a chicken
[08:15] <urlin2u> atdprhs, the os-prober is what searches for other OS's so in the external terminal sudo apt-get remove os-prober.
[08:15] <ryry> anyon know the terminal command that updates everything.is it apt-get?
[08:16] <zabomber> Could not access /dropbox/ (not WebDAV-enabled?):
[08:16] <rww> ryry: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[08:16] <ryry> thanks <rww>
[08:16] <atdprhs> can I edit it manually?
[08:17] <urlin2u> atdprhs, probably, but more risky, when all you have to do is reinstall t.
[08:17] <urlin2u> it*
[08:17] <atdprhs> urlin2u, I removed it
[08:18] <urlin2u> atdprhs, now run sudo update-grub and that OS will only be in its grun menu
[08:18] <urlin2u> grub*
[08:19] <atdprhs> 4 images found
[08:19] <atdprhs> can I edit their visible names?
[08:19] <urlin2u> atdprhs, probably two kernel sets on that HD
[08:19] <atdprhs> I updated the grub
[08:19] <urlin2u> atdprhs, I know a command to remove the memory line and put it back if needed.
[08:20] <urlin2u> atdprhs, generally having two kernels sets are advised
[08:20] <atdprhs> it's ok to keep it there, but I want to rename the main one to Portable Ubuntu
[08:20] <atdprhs> okayz
[08:20] <urlin2u> atdprhs, Iam not familiar there.
[08:21] <atdprhs> thank you urlin2u, is there anything else I should do?
[08:21] <Halabund> why can't I *read* ubuntuforums.org pages without registering first?  it's so unnecessary, I don't want to post, just read

[08:29] <dan_> but i said ask me later, but i cant seem to find out how to get it back now
[08:30] <absence> urlin2u: it says no is the "simple answer", do you know the details?
[08:30] <dan_> but it said i mean^

[08:33] <absence> urlin2u: any way at all, i mean :)
[08:33] <urlin2u> absence, not sure you could run a virtual, and a wubi probably works not sure there though, or a bootable external.
