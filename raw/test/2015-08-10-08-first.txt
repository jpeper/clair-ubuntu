[07:12] <syntroPi> wileee, i want to edit existing app launchers in the favorites panel
[07:13] <rainbowwarrior> Woo Hoo I am now dual booting windows 10 and Ubuntu 15.04 , thank you , i forgot to disable secure boot and found some other settings in my bios i needed to change and now all works fine :)
[07:13] <mike_1960> good deal
[07:13] <wileee> syntroPi, Can you be more exact?
[07:14] <mike_1960> good deal rainbowwarrior
[07:14] <aruns> There is a problem implementing installation , can you guess about this : xargs -a ~/packages sudo apt-get install --reinstall >  http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/   , Further I have explained on this thread : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2289974
[07:14] <mike_1960> secure boot
[07:15] <rainbowwarrior> mike_1960 yep
[07:16] <mike_1960> anything good has to take some work
[07:20] <syntroPi> wileee, i just got an answer in #gnome: the favorites panel references .desktop files from  ~/.local/share/applications and if not from there then from /usr/share/applications: it seems they have to be modified manually to edit the Exec=... command which launches the app
[07:20] <wileee> cool, carry on

[07:22] <aruns> Ok fine
[07:25] <Ben64> aruns: obviously ~/packages isn't right
[07:25] <syntroPi> wileee, thanks maybe my question was not formed clearly enough, im in need for some coffee :) the gui way seems to be alacarte btw (though im fine with editing files manually myself).
[07:26] <wileee> syntroPi, Not a problem, you got the help, it's all good. ;)
[07:27] <easyOnMe> hello everyone is there a way I can move the pop up menu bar on the left of ubuntu to be placed down at the bottom
[07:28] <aruns> Ben64 : How were you able to reach on conclusion that packages are not right?
[07:28] <Ben64> aruns: by reading your pastebin
[07:29] <aruns> Ben64 : that i know,  but you may have read some statements through which you have reached that conclusion, Any pointers?

[07:34] <easyOnMe> hello everyone is there a way I can move the pop up menu bar on the left of ubuntu to be placed down at the bottom
[07:34] <aruns> cfhowlett, Ben64 : i tried pinging 182.79.218.37 manually and it requires permission. I think i am going nut, I dont noticed it due to fatigue to deal with this problem for very long time
[07:35] <Ben64> aruns: how is installing packages related to pinging an ip
[07:35] <wileee> easyOnMe, Only if you roll the to the left one turn

[07:36] <easyOnMe> wileee: wow that was funny man
[07:36] <easyOnMe> but seriously is there a way to do what I wish
[07:36] <wileee> used to be a hack, nothing out there
[07:37] <wileee> was not a joke, but the reality of the desktop ;)
[07:39] <cfhowlett> aruns, I've read all your pastes.  this http://paste.ubuntu.com/12045252/ lines 6 - 15 are clearly in error.  I'd suggest you stop and take a nap.  then reinstall a clean ubuntu.  something is clearly very well scrambled which renders your system untrustworthy.  IMHO.
[07:39] <wileee> easyOnMe, Probably would be popular if there was a easy way, I suspect.
[07:40] <aruns> cfhowlett: Can i fix this system, Is it beyond repair?
[07:41] <cfhowlett> aruns, fix = reinstall from a clean, verified .iso
[07:42] <aruns> cfhowlett : I know thats the last option, what I am trying is to learn how to fix this system, Is it impossible? or information in our hand is not sufficient to address this problem.
[07:43] <aruns> cfhowlett : Fresh install is the quick way to get out of problem but what remains buried is unsolved problem.
[07:43] <aruns> cfhowlett: I appreciate leads provided by you.
[07:44] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: hello
[07:44] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: is there a way I can move the pop up menu bar on the left of ubuntu to be placed down at the bottom
[07:45] <wileee> Both of you easyOnMe and aruns have both just random;y addresses help, do not do that
[07:45] <wileee> this is free volunteer help, we are not obligated to help
[07:46] <cfhowlett> aruns as I understand it, you deleted several pieces of ubuntu-core while chasing the shiny python version.  that alone is enough to destabilize your system.  then the reinstall of ubunut-desktop failed with some very questionable errors pointing towards ? sources? install script?                Short answer: Ive NO idea what your system is doing, haven't seen this particular mix of fail before, thus my (sanity saving) suggestion to clean reinstall.  B
[07:46] <cfhowlett> UT ... YMMV
[07:46] <aruns> wileee : what yo intend to say from that statement? Any offence done by me
[07:46] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, no idea.  sorry.  UbuntuStudio here so I've literally never used unity.
[07:47] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: thanks
[07:47] <easyOnMe> you are cool man
[07:47] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, too cool for school :)
[07:47] <aruns> cfhowlett : Thanks for peeking into the problem, Would do that as last resort

[07:51] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, it is an official ubuntu flavor for multimedia production.  Much fun!
[07:52] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: does it it have any of those animation software similar to flash and flash actionscript
[07:52] <easyOnMe> of adobe
[07:52] <Sebsebsebb> Hi wireless worked when enableing the proprietary Broadcom drivers in additional drivers on a 15.04 Live USB, but in my install it's not working and I can't just enable it either. So what to do? Maybe I can Ethernet it and try and download from repos myself or something,
[07:53] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, plenty.  blender, inkscape for starters.  you can add those to your plain vanilla ubuntu or go to UStudio

=== Blaster is now known as Guest5957
[07:54] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: UStudio what does it have... I only want to do simple animation stuff just like what I did in flash of adobe what is its counterpart in USTudio
[07:55] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: blender is just way to high up there because it is already using 3D images and I have no exposure to that I only want to do 2D animation
[07:56] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, krita, gimp, pencil, mypaint, >>> synfig studio <<<
[07:56] <cfhowlett> synfig specifically for 2d anim
[07:58] <Sebsebsebb> Saying that there's another driver as well that it says isn't working and can't just enable
[07:58] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: ok I heard of those and I am currently using them except for krita, is it also free just like synfig studio
[07:58] <cfhowlett> all free!
[07:59] <cfhowlett> !krita
[07:59] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, krita can be used for animation but is primarily for digital painting.
[07:59] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: but synfig studio is not regularly being updated right
[08:00] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, check it:  http://www.osalt.com/
[08:00] <mka> hi
[08:00] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: oh ok have you used krita before what about inkscape have you used it too
[08:00] <mka> how can i open gconf editor on ubuntu 15.04?
[08:01] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, tried krita, more familiar with gimp and actually developed a tiny bit of skill with inkscape.  My snowman rocks!
[08:01] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: lol but is it also possible to animate thinks created in inkscape usng inkscape
[08:02] <easyOnMe> I have used inkscape and gimp very often
[08:02] <easyOnMe> for web design projects
[08:02] <easyOnMe> as I am more into open source
[08:02] <easyOnMe> I was just curious whether it is possible to create something like .gif file for those objects created in inkscape using inkscape
[08:03] <cfhowlett> easyOnMe, continue discussion in #ubuntustudio       more expert eyes
[08:03] <syntroPi> mka there is dconf-editor preinstalled (another conf system) but no gconf-editor, you would have to install that
[08:03] <easyOnMe> cfhowlett: ok thanks no problme
[08:03] <speedy__> hi
[08:04] <syntroPi> mka most of gnome3 apps use dconf though
[08:04] <syntroPi> gconf was gnome2 -ish
[08:04] <mka> syntroPi: ah i thanks, im installing gconf-editor i will check dconf too if what i want to configure is not working with gconf thanks
[08:08] <aruns> Can someone suggest how to take back up of "nano ~/package"
[08:08] <aruns> I want to create another copy of same file
[08:09] <Ben64> aruns: that file is no good
[08:09] <aruns> ok so end solution remains open, install afresh !
[08:10] <Ben64> yep, and next time be more careful with what you run
[08:11] <aruns> Ya mistakes are best teachers to make us learn, Will be cautious with system
[08:12] <aruns> it has devastated my system beyond repair, I have tried hard to learn and solve this problem but to no rescue I am failure by all means
[08:13] <mrsmart> Whata day!
[08:15] <cfhowlett> aruns, for future reference: apt-get -s purge python returns http://paste.ubuntu.com/12046583/              the "-s" means sandbox means not running the command.  seeing a list like this *should* cause one to think twice about whatever s/he is about to do.
