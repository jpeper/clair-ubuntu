[19:19] <Blackport> When I'm writing vainfo in terminal I don't see amd card, only information about Intel integrate card . I didn't check syslog

[19:21] <Blackport> lotuspsychje: nope ;/  I have asus k53sk laptop  so  they blocked this option in bios

[19:24] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje im using nouevaeu right now
[19:24] <lotuspsychje> xentity1x: try another maybe, to see if that influence nvidia-settings
[19:25] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje any idea how to figure out the best driver for your grpahics card?
[19:25] <dacorr_> trial an error until one of the nvidia drivers work
[19:25] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje> i see a few listed under additional drivers
[19:26] <lotuspsychje> xentity1x: ubuntu should normaly choose best driver by default, if you enabled internet + updates
[19:26] <dacorr_>  think 340 worked but my onboard intel is still complaining
[19:29] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje> i tried reinstalling nvidia-current
[19:29] <pbx> i solved my volume-keys-no-work problem.  it was some detritus from installing i3.  removed all i3 packages and rebooted and we're in business again
[19:29] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>now im using nvidia-304 proprietary. The gpu still isnt showing up on nvidia settings

[19:32] <Stoner19> hello all
[19:32] <Stoner19> is server the same as desktop, just without the GUI?
[19:32] <lotuspsychje> !server | Stoner19
[19:32] <ubottu> Stoner19: Ubuntu Server Edition is a release of Ubuntu designed especially for server environments, including a server specific !kernel and no !GUI. The install CD contains many server applications. Current !LTS version is !Trusty (Trusty Tahr 14.04) - More info: http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition - Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/14.04/serverguide - Support in #ubuntu-server
[19:33] <Stoner19> thank you. I wasn't sure if there were additional packages included in server or if it was just designed to be command prompt only but with same packages as desktop
[19:34] <lotuspsychje> Stoner19: server is non-gui indeed, with other needs then desktop
[19:34] <Stoner19> thank you very much
[19:34] <lotuspsychje> Stoner19: do you want to install ubuntu server?
[19:35] <Stoner19> yes, that is likely what I'll be using. Going to wipe an old macbook to install it on
[19:38] <mach20x> Should I update to 15.04 from 14.10 I have been having troubles with the graphics, it would seem
[19:39] <SchrodingersScat> mach20x: eventually you'll want to make a move anyway
[19:41] <mach20x> "The move" you mean
[19:41] <SchrodingersScat> if you wait too long you'll be headed off to 16.04 before you know it :)
[19:42] <lotuspsychje> mach20x: 14.10 is almost end of life, the move means you will have to update soon anyway
[19:44] <mach20x> I'm doing the upgrade as we speak
[19:44] <lotuspsychje> mach20x: good choice
[19:45] <lost> im using 15.04 now
[19:45] <lost> but i have dual boot for 14.04 also
[19:46] <lost> but i have some boot issues because of uefi with a layer of bios
[19:46] <mach20x> I just got a new modem installed, the Ethernet port fried during a lightning storm on the old one, I think that port was starting to go anyways
[19:48] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, okay got it!
[19:48] <lotuspsychje> xentity1x: how did you fix mate?
[19:48] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, I had to install the nvidia-331 drivers.
[19:48] <fellayaboy> is it possible to run a gui program without a desktop environment?
[19:48] <mach20x> I might have got some bad packages as a result of the failing Ethernet port on the old modem
[19:48] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, now any idea how to get it to detect my second monitor connected to the vga port
[19:48] <xentity1x> ?
[19:49] <lotuspsychje> !xrandr | xentity1x
[19:49] <ubottu> xentity1x: XRandR 1.2 is the new method of running dual screens in !X.  Information/HowTo here: http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
[19:49] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, this is the output of xrandr http://pastebin.com/zqahRfQS
[19:50] <mach20x> That maybe why it was crashing. EriC^^  has the lowdown on the output of my machine with regards to that problem
[19:50] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, Its not detecting the vga connection
[19:50] <lotuspsychje> xentity1x: you need to config xrandr, read the link mate
[19:51] <lotuspsychje> fellayaboy: if the package is also for terminal, you can run it
[19:52] <mach20x> Has there been any updates to the open source drivers in Ubuntu for my 4650 ati graphics cards (am doing variety)
[19:52] <fellayaboy> lotuspsychje: well yeah but what about x applications like firefox or calculator libreoffice…is it possible to run the command and load the gui app without the desktop environment?
[19:52] <mach20x> AMD not am
[19:53] <lotuspsychje> fellayaboy: not sure what you wanna achieve with this?
[19:53] <fellayaboy> or to somehow load a very very light weight desktop environment the moment it runs

[19:55] <fellayaboy> i also wanted to run gui apps off of an ssh server… i tried it to do it but some gui apps dont work while others do..but at least i wnted to try doing it locally…
[19:55] <lotuspsychje> fellayaboy: e17 (enlightment) is also cool
[19:55] <mach20x> fellayaboy:  are you running a chroot environment on a single core on a phone or something?
[19:55] <fellayaboy> raspberry pi
[19:56] <fellayaboy> ubuntu-mate…i had another ubuntu before where it was just the command line no deskto environment before i plan to do the same with this one
[19:56] <lotuspsychje> fellayaboy: you can also ssh X
[19:56] <mach20x> Ah OK, I figured it was something with very limited resources
[19:57] <fellayaboy> i use to run gui apps using ssh -X …some apps run the gui fine on the client but not most
[19:57] <fellayaboy> simple apps like gedit would work

[19:59] <Peret> The 'avahi daemon' is installed in Ubuntu by default. Are there security risks if I am using public networks (Free WiFi, ...)?
[19:59] <lotuspsychje> fellayaboy: no sweat mate
[20:00] <lotuspsychje> Peret: public wifi's are always a risk mate
[20:00] <lotuspsychje> Peret: they can sniff out passwords
[20:00] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, okay so I tried turning on vga1 with xrandr --output VGA1 --right-of LVDS1
[20:01] <Peret> lotuspsychje: Yes, I know. But what could others do if I have the avahi daemon installed? Could you tell me some examples for possible attacks?
[20:01] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, that doesnt seem to work
[20:01] <lotuspsychje> xentity1x: not sure about that man, sorry dont got 2 screens here
[20:01] <xentity1x> <lotuspsychje>, okay thanks

[20:16] <mach20x> I'm running my system on a TV with 1080p but the drivers I have won't recognize the hdmi converter. Should I load the propriety drivers for my graphics cards? Will that solve this issue?

[20:18] <Ev0luti0n_> installing it already from the sources.
[20:19] <Ev0luti0n_> What i am trying to say is that, "one sort of is capable of finding the solution through the windows guy for a problem that arises", while on linux, if i don't search the web, i am not capable of arranging a solution; ever. loll

[20:26] <mach20x> I guess I'll just have to try it and find out

[20:28] <mach20x> What would I do with xorg.conf now?
[20:29] <tgm4883> well you could hand configure it so the settings match what your TV can do, you'll need to set the ignore EDID flag

[20:46] <tgm4883> I'm not sure I understand the question
[20:47] <Peret> Can sombody explain me why ntpd opens port 123 by default although I only want to sync the time?
[20:48] <compdoc> beacuse thats the NTP port?
[20:49] <jParkton> :O
[20:49] <swair>  i'm compiling kernel 3.16 gcc versions are 5 and 4.8, i've set CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.8 still i get this error: fatal error: linux/compiler-gcc5.h: No such file or directory. anu ideas?
[20:49] <jParkton> looks like the script you are trying to compile is looking for => v5
[20:50] <swair> its the Makefile for kernel. i set CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.8
[20:50] <swair> so it should not look for the gcc5 header right?
[20:51] <hugegreenbug> Peret: ntpd is also a server, not just a client to sync the time. AFAIK
[20:51] <Peret> compdoc: But why not only send a ntp request to the server and get the answer? Why have the port be open all the time?
[20:51] <dionysus69> so if I want to install vnc server or client on ubuntu, what would I install? I guess there are several forks
[20:51] <mach20x> Should I replace /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  ?
[20:52] <hugegreenbug> Peret: If configured correctly, other clients could sync the time from your ntpd daemon
[20:52] <mach20x> From 14.10 to 15.04
[20:52] <Peret> hugegreenbug: Isn't there a possibility so that I use the program only as client?
[20:54] <hugegreenbug> Peret: I think by default it is setup to only be a client, but it still opens that port. You can check the ntp config file
[20:55] <hugegreenbug> Peret: I think it is in /etc/ntp or something
