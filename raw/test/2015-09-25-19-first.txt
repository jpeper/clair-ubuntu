[18:22] <CreativeWolf> genii, did that, same error messages with iptables -L
[18:22] <genii> CreativeWolf: I'm fresh out of ideas on it right now
[18:22] <CreativeWolf> genii, Thanks though! :)
[18:23] <CreativeWolf> genii, I think I might take a backup and get back to 14.04. Been running in to one too many issues with 15.04 not just on this box, on another one as well.
[18:23] <MonkeyDust> fred1807  no, but you can type all the commands in one lie, with ; in between
[18:23] <MonkeyDust> line*
[18:24] <MonkeyDust> fred1807  or maybe with a script
[18:25] <C_minus> What's the most comprehensive backup I can do without making a complete image of my Ubuntu partition?
[18:26] <C_minus> Is there a command to view a list of everything I've installed?
[18:26] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  rsync - a --progress ~ [from] [to]
[18:27] <lagbox> dpkg -l | grep ii    maybe
[18:27] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  rsync -a --progress ~ [from] [to]
[18:29] <fred1807> how do I use the GUI file manager with sudo powers?
[18:29] <MonkeyDust> fred1807  if you have to ask, you shouldnt do it
[18:30] <hexagonSun_> every time I turn my computer on, I have to configure my resolution and monitor underscan, how can I make it so it works "for ever"?
[18:31] <fred1807> MonkeyDust:  I am navigating trought the files of a SD card , it is a raspberry system, andI want to recover it
[18:31] <fred1807> MonkeyDust: Root files
[18:31] <C_minus> Why do people say it's easier/better to begin with Win7 and then install Ubuntu?
[18:31] <C_minus> (rather than the other way round)?
[18:31] <Finetundar> C_minus: because, 7 will override grub
[18:31] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  because windows ruins the grub menu
[18:32] <Finetundar> C_minus: Trust me, I've done it too many times
[18:32] <C_minus> But then can't I just run the Ubuntu installer stick and hit "repair"?
[18:32] <genii> C_minus: Windows only wants it's own bootloader to be installed and doesn't play nice with other ones
[18:32] <k1l_> C_minus: the windows install will override all bootloaders and doesnt care about other OS
[18:32] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  yes, you can repair it, if you like to fix things
[18:33] <k1l_> C_minus: of course you can. but its kind of doubled work.
[18:33] <k1l_> C_minus: and windows wants to sit in the first partitions in most times.
[18:33] <MonkeyDust> some people actually like to break and fix things
[18:33] <C_minus> So it's actually pretty easy - just more work/sitting around waiting for progress bars to fill up?
=== kpease_ is now known as kpease
[18:33] <Finetundar> C_minus: no
[18:34] <C_minus> what else do you have to do besides running the Ubuntu rpair stick then? Because that sounds pretty easy
[18:34] <Finetundar> C_minus: Unless things have changed there's a lot of terminal work required to restore grub
[18:34] <k1l_> C_minus: the easiest way is to install windows and then ubuntu. the other ways do work but need more work. that is way most guides and people say: do it the easy way
[18:35] <k1l_> Finetundar: there is boot-repair which helps out in most cases.
[18:36] <Finetundar> k1l_: never had any luck with that
[18:37] <C_minus> what kind of things in terminal? if I need to run the Win7 bootloader repair tool, will that mess up the Ubuntu bootloader/GRUB?
[18:39] <Finetundar> C_minus: almost guranteed. I have a bunch of guides bookmarked on my computer at home. But why do you want to install windows after installing ubuntu?
[18:40] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
[18:40] <k1l_> C_minus: you are making that a lot more complicated than it should be
[18:40] <Finetundar> ^^
[18:41] <C_minus> I already have Win7 and Ubuntu. But Ubuntu needs to gro, Win7 needs to shrink. Guides said maybe have to repair Win7 bootloader after this process: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-gparted-to-resize-your-windows-vista-partition/ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoResizeWindowsPartitions#Windows_Vista_and_Windows_7
[18:41] <akik> C_minus: if you write grub to the start of your linux partition, you can dd it to a file and then later in windows add it to windows boot loader with bcdedit
[18:41] <Finetundar> C_minus: so use gparted on a live image to reallocate space
[18:41] <mariano1_> Hi all, I am using a JAVA program in Ubuntu which displays a lot of messages in the command line. A couple of second after starting the program, the messages are displayed and compiz'sCPU usage raises to more than 100%. Is it normal? Should the compiz process use so much CPU? Or is the problem that my JAVA program displays to much messages in the terminal? When I don't run the JAVA program, then I have no CPU usage problems.
[18:42] <Finetundar> MonkeyDust: I think that's the best guide on that topic that I've seen
[18:43] <rockstar_> anybody knows what is the lubuntu minimalist size after installation?
[18:43] <MonkeyDust> Finetundar  "if all else fails, join #ubuntu"
[18:43] <C_minus> K1l and Finetundar: I'm just saying: that howtogeek page was talking about "Unless you are very lucky, you’ll be greeted with this horrible error message saying “Windows Failed to start.
[18:43] <Finetundar> C_minus: link
[18:43] <C_minus> http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-gparted-to-resize-your-windows-vista-partition/
[18:43] <Finetundar> MonkeyDust: well it usually helps

=== kpease is now known as kpease_
[18:44] <Finetundar> C_minus: that article is old. Things have changed
[18:44] <C_minus> Oh yeah?
[18:45] <Finetundar> C_minus: published in '07.
[18:45] <Finetundar> Very much out of date
[18:45] <MonkeyDust> C_minus  "Published 08/8/07"
[18:45] <C_minus> I just like to be cautious, read up about all the worst things that can happen after these awkward partitioning shannanigans.
[18:45] <Finetundar> C_minus: ubuntu is much more agreeable now
[18:47] <MonkeyDust> 2007... that's... how many releases ago?
[18:47] <k1l_> the first ones
[18:47] <Finetundar> MonkeyDust: 8 I think
[18:47] <Finetundar> actually no, more like 16 since there's around 2 per year
[18:48] <lagbox> 16
[18:48] <C_minus> OK didn't see that. But the Ubuntu one from 2012 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowtoResizeWindowsPartitions#Windows_Vista_and_Windows_7 talks about "If you find you cannot boot into Windows, this guide on recovering Windows may help." and suggests the same as howtogeek - which would cause me problems with GRUB...
[18:50] <parapan> MonkeyDust: ratrace: that page doesn't say anything about changing the root password
[18:50] <C_minus> And in turn, this is proposed as the solution to those GRUB problems: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[18:50] <Finetundar> C_minus: that's in the event that something goes wrong. More likely thatn not everything will be ok.

[18:50] <MonkeyDust> parapan  remind me?
[18:51] <parapan> MonkeyDust: login to ubuntu 10.04 server , lost credentials ...
[18:52] <parapan> MonkeyDust: the prompter I have sais: Ubuntu server login ......username ........than asks for password ......
[18:52] <MonkeyDust> parapan  yes, it says something about the user password, i'm not sure about the root password
[18:52] <C_minus> Just for conversation's sake then: if one uses the Win7 boot-repair, the problems for GRUB are the same as if Win7 had been installed AFTER Ubuntu?
[18:52] <genii> Yep
[18:52] <Finetundar> C_minus: yes
[18:52] <parapan> MonkeyDust: I do not have a user@server prompter ...I do not know the user also ...
[18:53] <MonkeyDust> parapan  then i don't know
[18:53] <parapan> MonkeyDust: k...looks like I'll have to re-install ...i wanter to avoid this ....
[18:53] <C_minus> So one ought to follow the instructions for restoring the Ubuntu bootloader, GRUB (which you say can be complicated, but this site says just run the wizard: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair)
[18:54] <k1l_> C_minus: the windows "repair" will always wipe all other bootloaders and will not boot other OSs. because of "we have the monopoly"

[18:54] <C_minus> Thanks MonkeyDust, Finetundar, k1l and the others. You#ve been very helpful for understanding this topic better.
[18:54] <Finetundar> C_minus: You really have nothing to loose if this is a fresh install. Just go for it
[18:54] <akik> k1l_: earlier too
[18:54] <Finetundar> C_minus: np

[18:55] <C_minus> See you later
[18:55] <Finetundar> C_minus: see ya!

[18:55] <k1l_> akik: ah, so with manual work
[18:55] <akik> computer work :)

[19:21] <Rimann> Fintundra: ok
[19:22] <Uhtred> Rimann: I do have access to the BIOS.
[19:22] <Finetundra> Rimann: is it up?
[19:23] <Rimann> Finetundra yes it warned me about being in 64 bit
[19:23] <Rimann> but its up

[19:37] <wileee> quants, your question is rather vague, safe is your definition, you're the safe factor in the end, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BasicSecurity
[19:39] <Bashing-om> quants_: If this is a stand-alone system. uninx is a cloased system and nothing can get to the 'root' of the system unless YOU do something that is ILL advised . Presently there are no known viruses in the wild that will effect linux .
